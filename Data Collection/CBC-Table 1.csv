,Health-care providers seek exemptions for therapeutic training in magic mushrooms,21-Mar-22,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/health-care-providers-push-for-exemptions-required-for-training-in-psilocybin-treatment-1.6385270,"Some health-care providers in Nova Scotia want more training when it comes to using psilocybin — commonly known as magic mushrooms — to help treat end-of-life distress and possibly other mood disorders.

But they say bureaucracy is stopping them from getting it. They say that hurts providers and patients.

""There's a high need for this therapy among folks who are experiencing end-of-life anxiety … depression and existential angst,"" said Jeff Toth, a registered nurse and advocate for psilocybin treatment.

""At this point not having therapists who are trained in this modality, it's limiting [patient] access.""

Toth, along with 15 other health-care providers in the province, recently entered a psilocybin training course, but they won't be able to finish it without an exemption from Health Canada.

The exemption permits people to take psilocybin, which is considered an illegal substance under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, in a safe and supervised setting based on medical or research needs.In January, Health Canada changed it so that the onus is on a person's physician to apply for the exemption though Health Canada's special access program, and then secure a Health Canada-approved synthesized version of the drug. 

To consider an exemption, Health Canada requires the physician to show their patient has ""serious or life-threatening conditions,"" and requires psilocybin ""for the purpose of emergency treatment."" Charlaine Sleiman, a spokesperson with Health Canada, said the department has notified 137 health-care professionals that it intends to refuse their requests since the change.

""There's been an unfair regional disparity with the government approving exemptions for folks on the West Coast,"" said Toth.

""There haven't been any clinicians who've been approved east of Montreal, and so that's setting up an unfair precedent.""

Sleiman said since granting some one-year exemptions to health-care professionals in 2020, Health Canada undertook further consultations. It concluded that clinical trials are the best approach for health-care professionals who wish to improve their knowledge of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy.

""Health-care professionals interested in using psilocybin or other psychedelics for training purposes can explore whether they can participate in this trial or apply for their own clinical trial,"" Sleiman said.

No clinical trials
But Toth said that's the problem. There aren't any clinical trials in the province and he said it isn't clear how to start one.

""Health Canada hasn't offered any specific criteria,"" Toth said. ""They've said in a more generic way that they're recommending that we go through clinical trials for it, but there's no real framework for that to happen.""

As of January, Health Canada approved only one clinical trial that examines the safety of administering psilocybin to healthy participants who are enrolled in a psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy training program.

""We're at this administrative roadblock,"" said Toth.

""I think it needs a bit more imagination and I think it needs more and more input from health-care providers on how to optimize the pathway."" The course Toth is looking to take is offered by TheraPsil, a small non-profit group that aims to help Canadians access legal, psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy.

Dave Phillips, a course trainer, said the experiential aspect is integral to the training.

""It's just very clear to us [people in the field] that, because we're working with altered states, that the practitioner themselves has to have their own experience with being in an altered state,"" said Phillips, a registered clinical counsellor with more than three decades of experience specializing in psychological health and safety, trauma and PTSD.

He said part of the training involves observing those partaking while they're in an altered state, as well as the trainee keeping a journal of their experience.

Phillips said those in the training will be required to take five grams or more because that is generally what a patient taking psilocybin for end-of-life care would need.

Alexis Goth, a hospitalist, said it's healthy to have some level of concern when it comes to approving the use of novel treatments, and that careful consideration of pre-existing conditions such as schizophrenia or other mood disorders should be taken into account. However, she said, with research in the area progressing, it's important health-care providers get this kind of training now to better help new and existing patients in the future.

""We're treating it a little bit like other pharmaceuticals or other types of therapy, and it can be very different because it can change your perception of reality and change your entire thinking strata,"" said Goth. 

""Nothing really else that we offer clients does that, and can predictably do that, so unless you're knowledgeable of what that could feel like yourself, you really may not be able to serve a client, when they're in that space."" Toth and 12 of the other denied health-care providers have sent a letter to Canada's Health Minister Jean-Yves Duclos. They hope to have their exemptions reconsidered in order to complete their training.

""In situations where there's a medical treatment available that will reduce disease, and that does not have a negative impact on public safety, the government doesn't have the option and has to grant the exemption, so we're optimistic that the government will follow the law there,"" said Nicholas Pope of Hameed Law, the firm that helped the group draft the letter.

Pope said if the exemptions aren't granted he will take the case to federal court for review."
,"Terminal cancer patient denied magic mushrooms after Health Canada rule change
Social Sharing
",28-Feb-22,https://www.cbc.ca/news/health/psilocybin-health-canada-palliative-care-1.6365516,"Janis Hughes is not ready to die. 

The very thought of it brings on an overwhelming feeling of panic. The 65-year-old Winnipeg woman has Stage 4 breast cancer, which has spread to her bones and right lung. Her condition is terminal.

""There's a sense of dread combined with urgency,"" said Hughes in an interview with Go Public.

""Am I going to get everything done that I need to get done and am I going to have the quality experiences that I want?"" she said. ""It's hard.""  Hughes was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 2011. She's had a lumpectomy, mastectomy, several rounds of chemotherapy and caught a flesh-eating disease in hospital. Now she's being told she has just two years to live — and she's holding on.

""I'm greedy for life still …I have baskets full of yarn waiting to be knit. I have all sorts of photography skills I want to learn. I have beautiful nieces and nephews that I want to spend time with,"" said Hughes. 

""I'm not ready to go. But I want to be ready to go.""  Hughes has spent hours researching how to improve her quality of life and believes psilocybin, a compound found in fungi commonly known as magic mushrooms, may be the answer.

The problem is that psilocybin is illegal in Canada.

Hughes and other patients with terminal illness have requested access to it for medical purposes — something Health Canada has allowed dozens to do in the last two years through a Section 56(1) exemption.

But last month, a week before she submitted her request, the rules changed. Hughes's request was denied.  

Health Canada says the rule change came because more research on the safety and efficacy of psilocybin is needed. But a chorus of voices working in the field of psychedelic therapy say the new system is creating difficult roadblocks — and causing more harm to palliative patients already struggling. 

Better quality of life, studies suggest
There is a growing body of scientific evidence that psilocybin may help lessen existential dread. 

For example, in a 2016 clinical trial of 51 psychologically distressed cancer patients, Johns Hopkins researchers found patients and their doctors observed ""decreases in [the patients'] depressed mood and anxiety, along with increases in quality of life, life meaning, and optimism.""There are more clinical trials underway with promising early results, said Ron Shore, a research scientist and PhD candidate studying the clinical application of psilocybin with the Dimensions Health Research Collaborative at Queen's University in Kingston, Ont.

""What we're finding … is people simply have a revitalization of interest in their life, a real reduction in their anxiety symptoms, and a real reduction in their depressive symptoms,"" he said. 

Research suggests psilocybin can affect the way areas of a person's brain communicate with each other, shutting off subconscious thought patterns to let others emerge.  Experts who spoke to Go Public say that with the right tools to process such an experience, the thought pattern of something like ""I'm no good""' or ""My life has no purpose"" can be diverted to something more positive and peaceful.

""For people at end-of-life who are struggling, psychedelics can simply offer insights into … their own kind of meaning of their own lives and their death, and raises a heightened sense of connectivity to others around them as well,"" said Shore. ""So it tends to improve their life."" 

For Hughes, she knows she could access magic mushrooms underground immediately. But she wants to be able to get psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, too. During the process, a therapist trained in psychedelic treatment guides a person through the experience and helps them integrate new ways of thinking into their daily life. Hughes would need to obtain the drug legally in order to take it to a specialized therapist and consume it in a therapeutic setting. On Jan. 12, after months completing paperwork, Hughes made a request to Health Canada for an exemption under Section 56(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

Two weeks later, Health Canada denied her request.

""I felt total, utter dismay,"" she said. ""I had every expectation that I was going to be approved, and I was telling my friends that I was going to be approved…. So I was absolutely shocked.""

In the rejection letter, Health Canada told Hughes she had not exhausted all possible legal routes available to access magic mushrooms. 

""For this reason, your exemption request is not being granted,"" the letter said.

Unbeknownst to Hughes, Health Canada had changed their rules. Health Canada adjusts protocol
Under the old rules, to request a Section 56(1) exemption to possess and consume psilocybin, a person must show they are seeking the drug for a medical purpose and make a case for access on compassionate grounds.

Patients needed to include a letter of support from their doctor that confirms their diagnosis is serious, and that shows previous treatments have failed. If granted, it would then be up to the individual to source the drug in any form.

On Jan. 5, Health Canada changed that. The agency added psilocybin to an existing list of drugs not approved in Canada, under what's known as the Special Access Program (SAP). Since that date, physicians have had the ability to formally apply for psilocybin in order to prescribe it to their patients — but it's a lengthy and complicated process. 

Now, patients are discovering that their only shot at accessing psilocybin is dependent on whether or not their doctor has applied through SAP, and experts say that's a problem. Through SAP, a physician takes on the responsibility for obtaining and administering the drug — as well as patient liability. On top of the eight-page application, physicians are tasked with monitoring their patient's outcomes and reporting those outcomes back to the government. The physician also has to source the drug for their patient from a list of Health Canada-approved manufacturers producing synthesized versions of the drug.  

Health Canada's criteria for considering an exemption through SAP is also more restrictive. According to a statement to Go Public from the agency, the physician must show their patient has ""serious or life-threatening conditions,"" and requires psilocybin ""for the purpose of emergency treatment"" — which the government doesn't clearly define.

Though Hughes's doctors were, for the most part, intrigued by their patient's desire to try psilocybin, Hughes says none of them would apply to SAP on her behalf. Dr. Valorie Masuda is a palliative care physician in Cowichan Valley, B.C., and the only doctor in Canada so far who has applied to access psilocybin through SAP. She says few physicians have the time or knowledge to do so.

""It's not even about just filling in the blanks,"" she said. ""Who's going to sit down and phone every single licensed dealer that Health Canada has listed and then try to engage with the CEO to say, 'Do you have health safety data?'"" 

She says she also had to provide Health Canada with references and evidence from clinical trials proving the safety and efficacy of psilocybin for end-of-life distress. 'They don't understand the urgency of this'
Bruce Rowles, 61, doesn't understand what Health Canada thinks it's protecting palliative patients from. 

""We're not going to be around long,"" he said. ""I'm just trying to get through what I have left with what I can salvage of my life.""

In September 2021, the Vancouver Islander learned he had terminal liver cancer after experiencing physical pain following his COVID-19 shots. He's already surpassed the number of months that his doctors thought he would live. 

In January, he applied for a Section 56(1) exemption to access psilocybin, and was turned down.

""When you know you're going to die and you're just waiting, it's the fear of the unknown,"" he said. ""What I think the psilocybin treatment would help with, it would just be taking away that underlying fear that is standing right behind me the whole time, just waiting to grab me."" His partner, Mandy Dobbs, says the government needs to have more compassion for people facing the end of their lives.

""They don't understand the urgency of this,"" she says.

""It's not something that can go through weeks and months of bureaucratic red tape until finally it gets to ... whoever the right person may be for them to put the stamp of approval.""

No difference between patients previously approved
Health Canada hasn't granted any Section 56(1) exemptions for psilocybin since adding the drug to the SAP list. Before that date, 79 patients were approved since August 2020. Go Public knows of eight patients denied exemptions since the rule change, including Hughes and Rowles.

""We were expecting this process to actually be, you know, easier for patients,"" said Holly Bennett, a patient advocate and communications director for TheraPsil, a not-for-profit group that helps Canadian patients access psilocybin and psychedelic therapy.

""That's not what we're seeing. We're seeing things actually get tighter, more restricted."" Bennett says TheraPsil has helped 58 patients get Section 56(1) exemptions. Hughes is one of their clients. 

""There is no difference between the 58 patients who have already been granted an exemption through Section 56 and Janis,"" said Bennett. ""The only difference is there's a new legal pathway.""

Bennet says Hughes's case is an example of how the government's new rules leave patients behind.

""It's been very frustrating."" Health Canada responds
Health Canada told Go Public that it is aware of the increasing interest in psilocybin for therapeutic purposes, but it wouldn't discuss specific cases or individual exemption requests. 

In an email, a spokesperson for the federal regulator said Health Canada reviews each request for psilocybin before making a decision about access.

""Health Canada's review includes consideration of the individual's medical condition, whether conventional therapies and other regulatory pathways have been considered, and the scientific evidence available to support the request,"" the email says. 

""While psilocybin has shown promise in clinical trials for the treatment of some indications, further research is still needed to determine its safety and efficacy."" The email said only health-care practitioners can submit requests to the SAP as they would be responsible for the treatment decisions for their patients. 

""Practitioners have the role and responsibility to clearly explain the harms and benefits of the drug to their patients, and to monitor and report the results of the use of the drug, including any adverse reactions, to the SAP,"" said the spokesperson.

Time to legalize psychedelics: scientist
Queen's University researcher Shore says Canada needs to rethink the way it classifies the use of psychedelics 

""There's no doubt that the benefits are there. The safety is there. I think that really, until we either legalize it or decriminalize psilocybin, people will continue to struggle with access.""

In the U.S., Oregon has legalized psilocybin therapy, and decriminalized psychedelics. Shore says the City of Toronto and the City of Vancouver have both requested Schedule 56(1) exemptions to decriminalize substances within their jurisdictions.

""Death is such a lost opportunity for us to gain wisdom, to gain insight and to gain comfort in the knowledge of our own lives and what's going to happen to all of us,"" said Shore. For Rowles, he says he's too close to the end now for his body to be able to process psilocybin. But his voice remains strong for his peers. 

""I need to try to do something for the next group of people coming along if I can't do anything for myself. I'm past where that's going to help me, but it will help other people.""

As for Hughes, she continues to work with TheraPsil in an attempt to persuade and encourage her physician to take on the SAP process. She's not giving up.

""I want total equanimity as to whether I live for another 20 years or I live for the two that my doctor told me I had,"" she said.  ""I want to be totally at peace with that."""
,"More patients granted psilocybin exemption by federal government
Social Sharing
",14-Dec-21,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/psilocybin-exemptions-granted-1.6285937,"Another three patients who have petitioned the federal government to use psilocybin therapy as a treatment for their mental health conditions have received an exemption from the minister of health to legally undergo this therapy. 

Psilocybin — the active ingredient in magic mushrooms — was banned in Canada in 1974, but recent trials have shown that it could be an effective way to treat severe depression, PTSD and other mental health conditions. 

Canada's health ministry granted the first four patient exemptions in August 2020 but further exemptions were slow to come. 

Surrey-based Nathan Kruljac, who applied for an exemption in March with help from the B.C.-based non-profit TheraPsil, was one of the patients granted an exemption. 

He released a statement through the organization saying it had been a long time coming. 

""I have been in agony for 15 years. This decision by the Minister to acknowledge my trauma and pain and allow me compassionate access to psilocybin may be the turning point in my life; it may not. The choice is mine and shouldn't fall to a decision made by an administrative department of our government,"" his statement read.

Many others waiting
Spencer Hawkswell, CEO of TheraPsil, said he is beyond excited for the patients who have been granted the exemption — but many more are still waiting, including 15 more patients with his non-profit. 

""It's a success story and we have to celebrate the small wins, [but] overall, my message to the government is that this is not even close to being over,"" Hawkswell said. 

""We're putting in new exemption [requests] almost every week ... Thousands of people have messaged us asking for support and unfortunately, we have to tell them the same thing which is we don't have the capacity to help you right now.""

Hawkswell said one positive aspect is that the exemptions are no longer just for patients who are in palliative care or have a terminal diagnosis. 

""When our MAiD (medical assistance in dying) legislation doesn't require death to be foreseeable, why would death have to be foreseeable for you to access a mushroom, too?""

Issues around safe supply
He noted that just because a patient has been granted a legal exemption to begin using psilocybin, it does not mean there is a safe supply of the drug available.

""There are 81 Canadians in total that have gotten [a legal exemption] to psilocybin and not a single one of them has been able to access safe supply even though there are tons of producers both around the world and Canada,"" he said. 

Health practitioners also have to develop proper treatments around the drug — which is hard when they need a legal exemption themselves and access to psilocybin. 

""Looking at this as a drug on its own or a substance on its own is an incorrect way of looking at it,"" said Hawkswell. 

""It's a drug therapy combination so the therapists need to be able to deliver it. Unless they have access to the substance for training purposes, they're going to be hard-pressed to develop how to properly provide the therapy."""
,"Magic mushrooms, psilocybin and microdosing: Growing trend draws e-vendors, scientists",02-Mar-22,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/microdosing-rise-canada-calgary-shrooms-1.6362036," Taking a micro-quantity of psilocybin as a mood booster is becoming a daily routine for more and more Canadians — and drawing the attention of entrepreneurs and scientists.

Psilocybin is the psychoactive substance in magic mushrooms, and though it is illegal, the online market for this substance is growing.

Scientific interest in psilocybin is also increasing — researchers are looking at its use as a treatment for depression.

""There is a re-emergence of interest and permission to start studying psychedelics,"" said Norman Farb, associate professor of psychology at the University of Toronto Mississauga.

""There is a huge amount of private sector interest in psychedelic therapies as the next big investment opportunity in the health sector,"" he said. The mental health expert will launch a controlled study over the next few months on nearly 100 people, who will be followed for five weeks.

The study will examine the effects of microdoses of psilocybin in people with low-grade anxiety and depression as well as in people with persistent depressive disorder. 

The project is the first of its kind in Canada. Farb and his team received the Health Canada approval late December.

Why this trend?
Microdosing capsules contain 50 to 300 milligrams of magic mushroom powder. They also contain the psychoactive ingredient: psilocybin. A full dose, 10 times that, is when the more commonly known psychedelic effects set in.

Between 2018 and 2020, articles from the New York Times and Forbes magazine introduced microdosing to the general public. Previously, the word was used only by Silicon Valley insiders and psychedelic aficionados.

On social networks, discussions on the subject have never been so lively. The number of forum subscribers on this topic in Reddit has increased sevenfold since 2018. More and more Canadians are interested in this illegal practice. Google searches with the keywords ""microdosing"" and ""shrooms"" (mushrooms) doubled in one year.

""This is not an underground phenomenon anymore. There are businesses that make a living out of microdosing, and obviously that changes the game a little bit,"" said Balázs Szigeti, professor at Imperial College London, one of the most renowned research centres in the field.

Health Canada says the national Drug Analysis Service (DAS), which operates laboratories across Canada to analyze suspected illegal drugs seized by law enforcement agencies, has found more magic mushroom compounds than ever before.

Between 2017 and 2021, the number has doubled nationally. The top three provinces in terms of drug seizures containing psilocin and psilocybin are Ontario, Quebec and Alberta. 

Sales are increasing
Online stores are booming as interest grows. CBC/Radio-Canada spoke to the vendors hidden behind four websites. All affirm that the competition is pushing prices down to attract the consumer.

All of them are based in British Columbia. They prefer to remain anonymous to avoid getting in trouble with the police.

Last April, after several years in the cannabis industry, Tally started selling magic mushrooms, encouraged by the positive effect they had had on her mental health.

""We've seen an increase in our sales. There are even health professionals who come to ask us for information. Ontario, Alberta and British Columbia are our best sellers,"" said this saleswoman. Trevor, on the other hand, has been in the industry for two years. Like Tally, he operates his e-shop from Vancouver. He has never tried microdosing and buys his products already packaged.

With his experience in online marketing, Trevor's main role is sending orders by mail and properly referencing his website to appear first on search engines.

""It's more a business decision to do mushrooms, to get on the trend before everyone else is on the trend. Now, It's increasing month over month,"" said Trevor, who is making up to $50,000 total revenue per month.

None of the vendors interviewed consider this drug trafficking, though Health Canada confirms they could risk up to three years in prison for violating the Food and Drug Act. 'It saved my life'
These days, Mike Brodeur walks the streets of Calgary with peace of mind. It's the city where he began his professional hockey career as a goaltender.

In 2010, a concussion spelled the end of his NHL career with the Ottawa Senators.

Despite painkillers and antidepressants, he found it difficult to recover.

""I was staying hours in my bed. I could not process what was going on. I was in a place of hopelessness,"" he recalled.

Then Brodeur discovered psilocybin microdosing on the internet. The practice is now part of his daily life.

""When I wake up in the morning, with my coffee, I take my pill, Monday to Friday. It gives me energy, focus, problem-solving, a better look at the future. It's been life changing,"" he said.

Still a lot to discover
Improving your mood, developing your creativity and reducing your stress — the promises of online stores have not yet been proven scientifically, says Claude Rouillard, a neuropsycho-pharmacologist at Laval University in Quebec.

""In the scientific literature, there is not a lot of evidence so far, but in the grey literature, on forums or social media groups, there are several people who report that this phenomenon of microdosing could have beneficial consequences on mental health in the short or medium term.""

Matthew Johnson, a professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Maryland, summarizes the situation: ""Scientifically, the field has not been able to confirm any of the claimed benefits in the few carefully controlled research studies conducted so far on microdosing. It could be, however, that the right type of study has not been conducted yet.""

What about the placebo effect?
According to Rouillard, clinical studies must be done on thousands of people of different ages, sexes and from various countries, in addition to research over several months to determine if the effects of psilocybin are stronger than the placebo effect.

""If you expect to feel better or because of a treatment or an intervention, then you're going to feel better,"" said Szigeti.

According to him, the growing public interest could create this placebo effect with some users and study participants. 

A lot of hope
""Having a fundamentally different class of drugs that isn't very harmful, that can produce benefits, would be revolutionary around the world. We actually have only a few types of drugs to treat anxiety, and many of them are problematic,"" said Farb.

""The idea behind it can lead us to major advances,"" said Rouillard. ""There hasn't been a lot of new stuff in the last 20 or 30 years in the treatment of mental health in neuropharmacology or psychopharmacology."""
,"Sask. man granted exemption to use 'magic mushroom' therapy for end-of-life anxiety
Social Sharing
",11-Aug-20,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/sask-man-granted-exemption-psilocybin-therapy-1.5680874,"A Saskatchewan resident has been approved by the federal Office of Controlled Substances to use psilocybin — an active ingredient in 'magic mushrooms' — to treat his anxiety. 

Thomas Hartle has Stage 4 colon cancer. The 52-year-old father of two was diagnosed in 2016. 

""I have been through three major abdominal surgeries. I've been through a couple of different sessions of chemotherapy which I am currently taking,"" Hartle said. 

""I had a bit of a remission for a couple of years and I had a recurrence in August of 2019. So at that time I am no longer eligible for surgery or radiation. Chemotherapy is currently my only option."" Hartle said there are a lot of things to deal with when diagnosed with terminal cancer. 

""I most certainly do what I can to get by day-to-day and you try to prepare for the future as best you can.""

Hartle said he is frequently hit with anxiety. He said there are prescription medications that mask the symptoms, but don't do much more. 

""Masking the symptoms is similar to if somebody had a heart attack and went to the hospital and they gave them morphine for the pain and sent them home,"" Hartle said. ""It's not a solution."" Hartle said he's looking for something to change the root cause of his anxiety. He said he first heard of psilocybin therapy while researching ways to manage neuropathy — a side effect of chemotherapy where a person loses feeling in their fingers and toes. Hartle said he found a type of mushroom used in traditional Chinese medicine and eventually found research done at the Johns Hopkins University on using psilocybin mushrooms for end of life cancer patients. 

For almost 20 years, researchers at Johns Hopkins's behavioural pharmacology research unit have been looking at the effects of psilocybin, mainly how it affects anxiety and depression in people with life-threatening cancer and in those with tobacco addiction. 

In 2016, the university published findings saying the majority of people suffering cancer-related anxiety felt ""considerable relief for up to six months from a single large dose of psilocybin."" 

The university said the drug was given in tightly controlled conditions with trained monitors. From 51 adult patients, about 80 per cent showed significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety six months after one dose, the university said in a statement. 

In January 2020, the university announced it would be expanding its research to look at how psilocybin may help those with opioid addictions and those with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The new studies are currently paused due to the coronavirus pandemic. Hartle and three other Canadians submitted applications to the Office of Controlled Substances asking to be allowed to try psilocybin therapy. 

""I'm not a doctor, but having read the research and a lot of the papers that researchers have put out it looks to be like it is potentially a way to allow a therapist and a patient to access some of the difficult things that you deal with,"" Hartle said. 

Psilocybin has been illegal since 1974. Last week, the office approved an exemption for the four Canadians.

""That was a really good day,"" Hartle said. ""Finding out that you at least have the opportunity to try something that might make a difference is really a hopeful moment for me.""  Advocacy group 'thrilled' for federal exemption for 4 patients
Hartle said he's been greatly helped by the advocacy group TheraPsil, which advocates for terminally ill patients to have access to the drug. TheraPsil said it had been campaigning for more than 100 days when the exemption was granted.

""We were absolutely thrilled,"" TheraPsil's Holly Bennett said. ""The biggest joy comes from knowing that these four individuals can now access a treatment option that can be very healing, and reduce the daily distress they face.""

TheraPsil said it will continue to advocate for others wanting access to the drug legally and wants the therapy to be accessible without a federal exemption.  Hartle said there have been some hopeful moments, but the anxiety continues to hit unexpectedly. 

""For anybody who has cancer, you understand that any pain you have has to be cancer,"" he said. 

He said he has tumours in his intestines that could cause a bowel obstruction, which would prevent him from eating and potentially split his intestines.

""So you can imagine that any ache and pain is almost immediately a source for a panic attack."" Hartle will now have to grow his own mushrooms to get the psilocybin, as they are not legally available in Canada. He said he hopes the public knows there is a large difference between using recreationally and using in a therapeutic setting.

""You are working with your therapist before a session to target your particular things that will be beneficial to look at during a session,"" he said. ""You are being guided and you have somebody who is looking after you.""

Hartle said that if the therapy works, he hopes maybe to take a trip down to an amusement park with his kids one more time once it's safe. 

""The hope of course is that I can spend my days without having daily anxiety and spend my time with my family and my kids, putting together the memories that you would like them to have,"" Hartle said. ""Doing things that I enjoy instead of thinking about not being here.""

",05-Jun-21,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/newfoundland-labrador/newfoundland-psychedelics-therapy-mental-health-addictions-1.6050247,"A Newfoundland woman who says psilocybin — a hallucinogenic compound found in some mushrooms — helped get her life back is sharing her story in the hopes it will change the perception of psychedelic drugs.

The 55-year-old wife and mother — CBC has agreed to withhold her name to protect her privacy — was diagnosed with severe post-traumatic stress disorder in her late 40s, brought on by childhood trauma. Traditional therapies and medications helped, she said, but over time she became resistant to treatment.

""It was making my anxiety worse. It was making my sleep worse. I was panicking all the time,"" she said. ""It would come in waves all day long, to the point where I would have to go to bed by about one or two o'clock in the afternoon because I was just exhausted from sort of fighting the demons.""

That all changed last winter, she said, after a weeklong retreat at a psilocybin psychotherapy clinic in Jamaica in February 2020. The drug is legal in that country, but not in Canada.

Health-care professionals were there at all times, she said, monitoring patients during their use of psilocybin, and each psychedelic trip was followed by intense group therapy.  While she did have a euphoric trip with calm waves and magical colours, she said, it wasn't all fun.

""It was intense work to get through the barriers that had been holding me back through my PTSD. That was really, really tough work and it wasn't a joyful trip in any way shape or form.""

She now microdoses with capsules, taken when she needs them, once or twice a week. She says she gets the calming effects without the high, even though she knows she's breaking the law. She's one of dozens of members of the Psychedelic Society of Newfoundland and Labrador. Founder Brandon Batstone created the society in April as a safe space for people to be open about their experiences.
""It's really hard for people to talk about these things. They are illegal,"" he said. ""Here in Newfoundland, there is no safe place for people to come together, talk about it, and to really share in a community of like-minded people who are advocates for the responsible use of these medicines.""

He says became a believer in the use of psychedelics after they helped him kick a drug addiction, when nothing else did. Batstone says he isn't trying to convince anyone to use these drugs; for him, he said, it's about education, awareness and changing people's perspectives.

""There's no way to remove the stigma until people like me and others come out and tell their stories. We should have access to it. I think that people should be aware of the consequences as well, because it's not all rainbows and butterflies.""

Psychedelics in science
There is a growing body of scientific evidence on the therapeutic use of psychedelics. The world's largest centre for these studies is John Hopkins Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research, where they use drugs including ketamine, MDMA, and psilocybin in experimental treatments for depression, PTSD, and Alzheimer's. A psychedelics studies program at the University of Toronto is awaiting Health Canada approval to use psilocybin in its research on microdosing.

But a world-renowned addictions expert says we're a long way from it being a part of mainstream health care.
""At this point it's a small, minuscule part of our approach to mental health problems because it's illegal,"" Dr. Gabor Maté told CBC. ""And governments have made it really difficult to even do studies. And the difficulty is the prejudice and the unscientific approach that regulation authorities have taken.""

Maté — an expert in trauma, addiction, stress and childhood development — says he has seen positive results over his 12 years of working with psychedelics.

""If you ask me, 'How safe is brain surgery?' well, if you did it on the highway in the middle of a busy intersection out on the street, it wouldn't be safe at all. But in the proper hospital setting with trained professionals, there are some risks, but it's highly safe. Same for psychedelics … and I would say at least as safe and a lot safer than the psychiatric drugs that we regularly give to people these days.""

Dr. Pierre Blier, a professor in the University of Ottawa's psychiatry department, is more cautious. He is studying the use of ketamine for treatment-resistant patients with depression, work he says is done under highly controlled conditions. But he notes it's still experimental and people should be careful when seeking their own treatments.

""When you buy something from a non-regulated source, you don't know what you are buying.""

While Batstone believes in the use of psychedelics and is willing to be a face for the movement, the woman in her 50s is reluctant even to tell her family doctor. But she hopes one day the scientific proof will be on her side, so others can get happiness back in their lives, something she never thought was possible for her.

""I had to be at that point where I could talk about my trauma. And then the psilocybin took me the rest of the way,"" she said.

""I really do see it more as  when you're at that point where your treatment-resistant, there's just nothing that's working. I think that's what I want to make sure people understand, is that this was a process, this wasn't something I just jumped into."""
,"Health Canada dragging feet on approving magic mushrooms for therapeutic use, patients and advocates say
Social Sharing
",27-Jul-21,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/exemptions-psilocybin-therapy-1.6118296,"Nathan Kruljac was a young man of 25 when he experienced some shortness of breath while out for a drive in Surrey, B.C. He went to a walk-in clinic. Minutes later, he was taken to hospital. After a week of tests doctors had a diagnosis: follicular non-Hodgkins lymphoma. While treatment eventually put the cancer into remission, Kruljac says he never truly recovered. 

Fifteen years later, he still suffers from trauma and PTSD.

""I still see [the cancer] as a time bomb rather than a success,"" he said. ""I'm scared and fearful of reoccurrence."" 

Kruljac says conventional antidepressants and counselling only did so much to help. Now a husband and father, he feels he's often failing his four-year-old daughter. 

""I want to feel human again. I want to be able to look at my front door and not be terrified,"" he said.

Last August, Kruljac got a sliver of hope when he read that Health Minister Patty Hajdu had granted a legal exemption to Saskatchewan cancer patient Thomas Hartle, allowing him to use psilocybin as an adjunct to psychotherapy. It was the first of several dozen exemptions Hajdu would grant, to patients and even some therapists, for the psychedelic compound in what are commonly called magic mushrooms. Psilocybin was banned in Canada in 1974. It and the mushrooms which contain it remain illegal under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). 

But psilocybin is also, now, at the forefront of a renaissance in psychedelic therapy, due in part to persuasive research at institutions such as Johns Hopkins University and the University of California.

Some peer-reviewed studies have found that psilocybin has antidepressant effects and can allow patients, with the help of trained therapists, to confront fears and feelings that are otherwise too traumatic.

Patients granted an exemption typically take a one-time five-gram dose, enough to induce a full-on psychedelic experience, in tandem with planned therapy the day before, during and after the dose is taken.

Kruljac applied for an exemption in March, with help from TheraPsil, a B.C.-based non-profit group that convinced Hajdu to grant that first psilocybin exemption.

""What's the worst that can happen?"" he said. ""It doesn't work, and I'm back to square one.""

But more than four months later, Kruljac has heard nothing back from Hajdu or her department. Scores of other applications seem to have also gone into limbo. 
 Most of the previous exemptions were granted in a matter of weeks, with at least one approved in a couple of days, according to TheraPsil. Most of the 64 exemptions granted to date were issued last year. They went to 45 patients and 19 health professionals, according to Health Canada.

""What upsets me is that there are 50 other people in this country that have been given the exemption to choose their own path to healing. I am being treated differently which goes against our Charter of Rights and Freedoms,"" he said. ""And that's what's really upsetting me right now because there's not only myself, but there are other people.""

One of them is Jim Doswell. The 67-year old from Victoria has survived colon cancer and T-cell lymphoma. But he lives with the after-effects of both that battle and some difficult years as a negotiator and a senior adviser to a federal deputy minister. 

""I suffer from anxiety and depression and post-traumatic stress disorder,"" Doswell said. ""I have quite disabling anxiety.""

Two months ago, Doswell applied directly to Hajdu for an exemption to use psilocybin. He's still waiting for a reply. 

""With all due deference to the minister, I don't need her for this,"" Doswell said. ""I can go down the street in Vancouver to [black-market] dispensaries and buy this product."" But, Doswell says, without the minister's permission, no therapist is likely to help him.  

Even some who have an exemption feel as if they're doing something wrong. In St. John's, a teacher who was successful says the system for approving the exemptions is opaque and arbitrary, leaving him fearful to reveal his name.

""My biggest apprehension, I guess, is my career,"" he confided, because the exemptions seem to be in a grey area — legal only under certain conditions, and because the minister says so.

""I would expect some potential repercussions,"" he said. 

Neither Hajdu nor spokespeople for Health Canada have been able to explain why the application approvals have stalled. In a recent statement Health Canada said it is ""committed to thoroughly reviewing each request for an exemption … on a case-by-case basis, taking into account all relevant considerations."" 

Kruljac isn't satisfied. On Monday, lawyers paid by TheraPsil served the government a notice of application, filed a federal court, seeking to compel an answer from Hajdu.

TheraPsil's CEO Spencer Hawkswell says there's a bigger issue at stake than one person's ability to legally use psilocybin. 

""An overwhelming majority of Canadians support regulations for people who need access to the medical psilocybin,"" he said, referring to the results of a poll conducted for TheraPsil last month.

TheraPsil wants to see psilocybin and the mushrooms removed from the CDSA, and have it regulated much like medicinal cannabis was 20 years ago.

""We want to make sure that we're doing justice to those who need access. Because, you know, you can always fight the government in courts. But that's not what an effective government does. Effective government listens to people.""

Hajdu's office didn't respond to an interview request about TheraPsil's legal manoeuvre. A spokesperson for Health Canada said it needed more time before commenting.

,Patient hopes Canada will introduce regulations for psychotherapy with 'magic mushrooms',18-Jan-21,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/magic-mushrooms-regulations-canada-1.5877324,"As the first terminally ill cancer patient in Canada to legally use so-called magic mushrooms to treat anxiety, Thomas Hartle is hopeful that more temporary approvals from the federal government signal a permanent regulatory regime may be in the works.

Hartle, 53, received a one-year exemption from the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act last August to use psilocybin, the active psychedelic ingredient in magic mushrooms, during psychotherapy.

Since then, Health Canada has approved 24 more applications from cancer patients for treatment of end-of-life distress. It has also granted exemptions to 19 health-care providers, giving them the right to possess and use mushrooms containing psilocybin for professional training purposes, a spokesperson said in a statement.

The department has yet to decide whether it will allow the public to use any psychedelics for therapeutic purposes beyond the exemptions it has granted so far. Hartle has had two psychedelic psychotherapy sessions at his home in Saskatoon, the last one in November, with psilocybin from mushrooms he grew and dried himself using a coffee grinder to turn them into powder and placed into capsules for precise dosages.

The IT administrator, who is on leave from his job, said anxiety over dying from colon cancer and leaving his wife and two children, who are both on the autism spectrum, became unbearable after his inoperable condition was diagnosed in 2016.

However, taking psilocybin during his two sessions with the help of his regular clinical psychologist helped him manage his anxiety to the point that he hasn't felt the need to have any more psychedelic-assisted therapy while he continues traditional therapy, Hartle said.

""I think that's probably obvious to most people who have interacted with me before and after my sessions,'' he said of the marked improvement in his anxiety. ""I've been talking about subjects I would previously have considered almost impossible to talk about and keep a clear voice and not break down into a very emotional state. Instead of focusing on the pain or discomfort, I'm focusing on making lunch for my family, or something like that,"" he said.

Before each of the two sessions, Hartle said he met with his therapist and completed paperwork to gauge his anxiety level in order to establish a baseline that could be compared with how he would feel afterwards.

The first session lasted about six hours, during which he took three capsules about an hour apart, containing a total seven grams of psilocybin, he said.

His therapist and a friend remained by his side as he lay blindfolded and wearing a headset while listening to music from a playlist compiled by Johns Hopkins University as part of its research into psychedelics.Hartle said the range of music, from classical to chanting as well as South American and African beats, elicited different emotions and he saw multiple colours and geometric shapes as he entered ""a state of other,"" which made it impossible for him to recall the names of his family members.

""It was very serene and comforting to me to realize that I could have consciousness and awareness that had nothing whatsoever to do with this existence.""

Hartle said that prior to his cancer diagnosis, he had never used illegal substances and only started taking cannabis oil to deal with the nausea brought on by chemotherapy as part of his cancer treatments.

Focused psychotherapy sessions before, during and after his two sessions were crucial to his use of psilocybin, Hartle said.

""It's not like you take a pill and suddenly everything is fantastic. It doesn't work like that any more than regular therapy does. There is work to be done. There are challenges to face. There are issues that need to be worked through the same as any other session,"" he said.

""The main difference is that with the psychedelic-assisted therapy, it can get your ego out of the way so you can get at some things.""

Health-care providers exploring psilocybin options
Spencer Hawkswell, CEO of TheraPsil, a Victoria-based advocacy group for patients, said it helped Hartle apply for exemptions to use psilocybin on compassionate grounds based on Canadians' right to medical assistance in dying.

He said access to assistance in dying should also give terminally ill patients the right to try mushrooms to reduce their emotional suffering.

""When we can't manage someone's symptoms, that's often when they choose MAiD. [Psilocybin] deserves to be put in between the treatment options that are failing those patients and MAiD.'' TheraPsil has helped people from six provinces apply for exemptions.

Health-care providers who have received exemptions to use psilocybin themselves before leading psychedelic-assisted sessions include family doctors, nurses, psychologists, psychiatrists, clinical counsellors and social workers, Hawkswell said, adding the group is putting together a training program that will need partnerships with provincial governments.

'The next big thing'
Psilocybin is just one of several psychedelics being considered to treat mental health conditions while a growing number of private companies promote their potential use for multiple issues including obesity, smoking, alcohol dependence and addiction to illicit substances.

Mark Haden, chair of the board for the Canadian chapter of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS Canada, said psychedelics appear to be seen as the new cannabis before it was legalized.

""A lot of venture capitalists went into the cannabis world. Many of them made money. Some of them lost a huge amount of money, so the cannabis bubble exploded and then burst. So, all of that money is saying, 'Where do we go next? What's the next big thing?' And they've latched their view on psychedelics,"" Haden said.

MAPS Canada is currently conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial in Vancouver on the use of MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy, to treat post-traumatic stress disorder.

Some doctors, therapists get Health Canada permission to use magic mushrooms
Haden said the small trial involving about 12 people is expected to be completed next year as part of the research by over a dozen sites in the United States and Israel.

Traditional PTSD therapy has a high dropout rate, may involve patients taking medication for years and has an effectiveness rate of 10 to 25 per cent, said Haden, who is also an adjunct professor at the University of British Columbia's School of Population and Public Health.

""With MDMA, it takes a few months and the effectiveness is 60 to 80 per cent,'' he said of research findings elsewhere."
,New U of C research position 1st in Canada to focus on psychedelic drug therapy for mental health,09-Jun-21,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/u-of-c-psychedelic-drug-research-1.6059821,"Jim Parker was impressed enough with the improvements his niece had shown after being treated with psychedelic drugs for post-traumatic stress disorder that he was willing to put up his own money for further research.

The Calgary trader anted up $3 million for a new position at the University of Calgary focusing on the use of psychedelic drugs including ketamine, ecstasy and psilocybin — commonly known as magic mushrooms — to treat mental illness.

The university says the position is the first of its kind in Canada — similar research is being done at Johns Hopkins University in the U.S. The U of C has begun an internal candidate search to fill the position.

Parker said he became interested a couple of years ago when his adult niece, Courtney, was suffering from PTSD and addiction issues.

""She tried everything else. She tried antidepressants. She tried rehab and she was stuck for a number of years,"" Parker said.

Courtney was paralyzed by flashbacks, terrified to leave her home and unable to study for school. She was prescribed several medications, but said she felt numbed, trapped by her own mind and unable to heal.

""We sent her to a ketamine clinic in Los Angeles. The results were incredible. After years of struggling it was like she just snapped back and was the Courtney we had known several years prior,"" said Parker.

The Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto describes ketamine as a fast-acting anesthetic and painkiller used primarily in veterinary medicine. It can produce vivid dreams and a feeling of mind-body separation in humans.

Parker said his niece is still in therapy but the improvement is amazing.

""She's smiling again. She's back in school and really thriving.""

Parker said Courtney received five rounds of intravenous ketamine therapy, precisely dosed and under medical supervision.

The field of psychedelics to treat mental health is attracting growing interest from the scientific and medical communities. Dr. Valerie Taylor, a psychiatrist and clinician-researcher at the University of Calgary, will oversee the search for who will hold the new position. She said more extensive research into the use of psychedelics is needed.

""Most of the studies have been small. They haven't been particularly designed properly to carry weight with the regulatory bodies,"" Taylor said.

""We're hoping to take it to the next level and really see if we can work with scientists across the globe and regulatory bodies to help push this field in this direction.""

Taylor, who studies new treatments for mental illness, said it's important to know whether promising research is on track.

""Hopefully it's a move forward, because the research shows this is something that really makes a difference. But if it doesn't seem to be as positive as some of the anecdotal stories say, we also need to know that so we don't waste time and money,"" she said.

""There's enough preliminary evidence to make it worthwhile looking further. Does that mean at the end this is going to be the next panacea? Absolutely not, but maybe it will work for some people.""

Psychedelics remain a restricted substance in Canada although Health Canada has granted some exceptions that allow for individual therapy sessions using psilocybin for the terminally ill. 

Parker is also starting a private medical clinic in Calgary, Bloom Psychedelic Therapy and Research Centre, to provide a place for legal ketamine-assisted therapy and possible future research trials. 

The University of Calgary will also be holding a free online lecture on the use of psychedelic drug therapies on June 25. "
,"Southwestern Ontario lab seeks rare permission to make, study psychedelic drugs",28-Apr-21,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/psilocybin-research-ontario-1.6003849,"A Toronto-based cannabis company is looking for a rare exemption under federal drug control laws to build a first-of-its-kind laboratory for southwestern Ontario to produce and study psychedelic drugs. 

New Leaf Canada announced that within the next two months, it would begin an expansion of its existing 32,000 square-foot cannabis production facility located on a 64-acre farm in rural Norfolk County, southeast of Tillsonburg, Ont.

The laboratory, which will adjoin New Leaf's existing production facility, would be used to produce psilocybin and psilocin, a hallucinogenic drug found in magic mushrooms that has been illegal for decades in Canada but has recently become an emerging treatment for mental illness and addictions. 

The facility, which New Leaf subsidiary Psirenity will run, would be used to develop mushroom strains, new methods for extracting the drugs and eventually conduct clinical trials, according to Psirenity CEO Chris McCullogh. 

Psychedelic research an emerging field
""We'll be working with psilocybin and psilocin,"" he said.  ""The belief in the science and the early indicators are that psilocybin can help with that increased global brain activity."" Psychedelic research has become an emerging field in medicine, with scientists looking at psilocybin's potential to treat a host of disorders ranging from anxiety and depression to obsessive-compulsive disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder, even easing the fear of an imminent death. 

Recently, the federal government has also begun loosening laws around the drugs. Health Canada gave four exemptions to palliative care patients to use the drug for end-of-life psychotherapy last August.

Since then, other exemptions have been given to patients who want to use magic mushrooms and therapists who want to develop new treatments using the drugs. 

Right now, only a a handful of health practioners in Canada offer therapy using the drugs and currently, there are no approved therapeutic products containing psilocybin in Canada. 

McCullogh said through its research, Psirenity hopes to one day change that by studying the potential health and wellness applications of micro-dosing, the practice of taking tiny hits of psychedelic drugs to improve mental wellbeing that's growing in popularity but remains unstudied and largely unproven. 

""This is something that doesn't have any psychotropic effect. The dosage is very low. It's something you can take and go about your day and go to work, so it's not something that creates hallucinogenic effects.""

Users who take minute doses of hallucinogenic drugs say it can improve mood and relieve anxiety and has gained a large following on some social media websites. 

Microdosing 'really promising' but 'still a far cry' from medicine
A groundbreaking study conducted by the University of Toronto and York University into the phenomenon in 2018 found microdosers reported higher creativity and wisdom and lower negative and dysfunctional attitudes. Researchers said the results were ""really promising,"" but psilocybin is ""still a far cry"" from being considered medicine. 

McCullogh said Psirenity hopes that with further research, scientists can prove whether psilocybin makes a measurable difference in people's lives and could one day be used as an alternative to traditional pharmaceutical anti-depressants.

""It's not an addictive process, something that you are addicted to, nor does it have lingering side effects,"" said McCullogh.

""Traditional treatment measures aren't solving all the problems and many people are looking for alternative options and we firmly believe and studies are showing that microdosing can unlock and help a person on their path to achieving their optimum brain health wellness.""  "
,"Psychedelic drug therapy now offered at Calgary clinic, the first of its kind in Alberta
Social Sharing
",19-Feb-21,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/first-clinic-to-use-psychedelic-therapy-in-the-province-opens-in-calgary-1.5919714,"In January, an Airdrie man with terminal cancer received the first federally approved magic mushroom treatment in Alberta. This week, the first clinic in the province to use psychedelic therapy has opened in Calgary.

The ATMA Urban Journey Clinic is in northwest Calgary and will be a training centre for mental health professionals from across Canada.

CEO David Harder says the clinic is the result of decades of research and trial studies.

""It's kind of the opposite of what a typical antidepressant or psychotic medication would do,"" he told The Homestretch.

""Typically, they will suppress or numb down what's happening in your emotions and spirit body, whereas the psychedelics will actually raise those things and allow a therapist to work with you to really work through and not just suppress whatever that is that's holding you back, for example, for depression or anxiety, PTSD especially.""

For Tony White, the magic mushroom therapy allowed him to let go of some of the anxiety and depression that had been crowding in since his terminal cancer diagnosis. He received the therapy on Jan. 1.

""I just was lying there and I felt like I couldn't be at more peace then, right then and there,"" said White in mid-January. Psilocybin, the active drug in magic mushrooms, has shown promise in relieving end-of-life distress for palliative cancer patients, but it's still undergoing clinical trials.

Since August 2020, Health Canada has granted 20 exemptions to patients diagnosed with cancer to treat their end-of-life distress. 

Currently, Health Canada grants exemptions that allow for individual therapy sessions using psilocybin for the terminally ill. The new clinic will start with this mandate, but Harder hopes to see it expand. 

""We're also applying on behalf of a number of people with mental health conditions, depression, anxiety and PTSD. So we're going to see if they approve those who are waiting to hear.… They seem very open to the idea, but obviously they're being very cautious and moving slowly for safety's sake.""

The clinic will administer only magic mushroom therapy for now, partly for safety reasons.

Harder explained it's difficult to find other psychedelic drugs in a pure state as they are often laced with fentanyl and cutting agents.

""That's why we're only sourcing mushrooms at this point,"" he said. ""It's a mushroom. So you can see it. It's a dried mushroom. So that's where Health Canada is saying it's a much less risk than, say, some of the white powder drugs that are being used for psychedelics."" Palliative care therapy is being offered at no cost.

""We believe it's something we can give back,"" Harder said. ""We're moving forward with mental health treatments that will be charged for the treatment of therapy, the therapist's time and on the sitting time. But with the palliative care, we believe this is something where we can give back.""

Harder said there is a screening process as part of the exemption application. He said each case may vary but generally the participant undergoes counselling sessions before and afterward. And, he said, there are a couple of people on hand during the four- to five-hour psychedelic experience, including a therapist, psychologist or psychiatrist.

The psychedelic therapy will be overseen by the clinic's chief medical officer, psychiatrist Dr. Ravinder Bains. Harder said this form of therapy, once more widely accepted, holds promise for a wider range of treatments.

""The studies have been done,"" he said. ""We know this is safe. We know this is efficacious. We know it helps. And with the growing mental health crisis in our country, we know that this is something that could really help the issues that our society is facing."""
,B.C. non-profit challenges Health Canada to end 50-year prohibition on magic mushrooms,03-Aug-21,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/therapsil-health-canada-psilocybin-1.6128123,"A B.C.-based non-profit organization is challenging Health Canada to end a nearly 50-year prohibition against possessing so-called magic mushrooms and the potent psychedelics they produce.

TheraPsil, which advocates for the therapeutic use of the psychedelic compound psilocybin, spent months drafting proposed regulations for so-called magic mushrooms based on the same ones the federal government first created 20 years ago for medicinal cannabis.

TheraPsil CEO Spencer Hawkswell said his organization sent a 165-page proposal to Health Canada's director general Jennifer Saxe.

""This is taking all of the bureaucratic processes, all of the hard work that people put into cannabis, such as how to apply for a license if you want to grow it ... and just making it the exact same for psilocybin,"" Hawkswell said. The document deals with managing every aspect of licensing growers and sellers, from who can be involved, where they can be located, quality control, security and packaging. There are also provisions in the draft for patients to register to grow their own, as well as a formula for calculating how much an individual can grow, based on the amount of mycelium, the branch-like organism that produces the mushroom as fruit.

Some exemptions issued
Psilocybin is prohibited in Canada by the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA). The drug has been illegal since 1975. But just last year, the health minister started using her authority under a section of the act to grant legal exemptions, mainly to people with terminal illness and treatment-resistant depression.

To date, 64 patients and therapists have received legal exemptions from Health Canada, which are valid for one year. But the department acknowledges more than 150 applications it has received have gone unanswered. Hawkswell said Health Canada's director general was open to receiving his organization's attempt at drafting a legal framework.

 ""I mean, they're giving exemptions to patients who have to find a substance on the street and who are unable to get help from a doctor and a therapist,"" he said.

Hawkswell said it is a safety issue that is entirely within Health Canada's mandate to consider.

Paul Manly, Green Party MP for Nanaimo-Ladysmith in B.C., hasn't seen the draft regulations, but he suggests regulating psilocybin is inevitable.

""The government initially, with medical cannabis regulation, had to be pushed through the courts,"" Manly said. ""Now, I think that they're starting to look at the research ... that psilocybin can be used for a range of mental health issues, including PTSD and depression."" Nathan Erskine-Smith, Liberal MP for Beaches-East York in Ontario, a self-described decriminalization advocate,  welcomes psilocybin regulation. He's hesitant to gauge how much backing the idea has, even in his own party, especially ahead of a rumoured election, but he said there is support across party lines.  

""Post-election, I think there is room to continue to move the conversation forward and to see progress.""

'Health Canada is in a difficult position'
TheraPsil isn't the only group eyeing regulations to make possession and use of psilocybin and the mushrooms which produce it, a matter between a doctor and patient. The Multidisciplinary Association of Psychedelic Studies and the Canadian Psychedelic Association (CPA) are also drafting their own regulatory blueprints for Health Canada to consider.  

Dr. Pamela Kryskow is a founding board member of the CPA.

""I think Health Canada is in a difficult position,"" she said. ""And we think that because we've really gone through this, really thoroughly and really thoughtfully, that this will hopefully be a gift to them to have done their work for them."" Jim Doswell is a former federal treaty negotiator with First Nations in B.C. who has himself applied for a ministerial exemption to use psilocybin to aid in his therapy for PTSD. He has offered TheraPsil his insights into the regulatory process as the group was drafting its proposals. Doswell is under no illusion that Health Canada will act quickly, or at all, on any suggestions for regulation, no matter how complete or comprehensive they may be.

""All they have to do is agree, but of course, it's never that simple. The bureaucrats will have to go over it with a fine tooth comb. And then you have the political side of it,"" Doswell said, referring to the perceived political consequences of legalizing a psychedelic that's been banned since 1974.

Neither Health Canada nor its director general were available to comment. The department's official stance is to endorse clinical trials as a means to further study psilocybin's potential benefits and risks. Advocates, however, say enough scientific studies have been done to warrant regulation now.

,"As psychedelic therapy goes mainstream, former patient warns of danger of sexual abuse
Social Sharing
",18-Mar-21,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/bc-sexual-abuse-psychedelic-therapy-1.5953480,"Meaghan Buisson agreed to take part in a clinical trial on the use of MDMA for treating post-traumatic stress disorder after what she calls a ""year of darkness."" 

She was homeless in Vancouver and out of treatment options as she confronted the aftermath of sexual abuse and assault.

""It was a Hail Mary. It was like, well, what do I have to lose, really?"" Buisson, now an instructor with Outward Bound Canada, recalled in an interview with CBC News.

In early 2015, Buisson embarked on a Phase II clinical trial sponsored by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS). Court documents show that her co-therapists were a married couple living on Cortes Island near Campbell River — Richard Yensen, an unregulated psychotherapist, and psychiatrist Dr. Donna Dryer. 

""What I had been told was that psychedelics open you up and there's deep healing,"" Buisson said. 

""There was no mention ever of the risks of sexual abuse.""

But there's a documented history of sexual violation within psychedelic therapy, and Buisson has alleged that Yensen took advantage of her vulnerability to do the same.

She believes there is potential for psychedelics to be healing and says they may have a place in the health-care system, but the risk of serious harm means safeguards are essential. That includes stronger oversight of clinical trials, better measures to prevent abuse and strict regulations for who can provide psychedelic therapy — or, for that matter, any type of psychotherapy. MDMA, also known as ecstasy, is a recreational drug that produces feelings of euphoria and enhances sensation and sexuality. It's one of several illicit substances, including ketamine, LSD and psilocybin mushrooms, that's currently being studied for potential uses in psychotherapy.

These substances are slowly making their way into mainstream patient care. Health Canada has begun granting exemptions for the legal use of magic mushrooms in therapy, and the College of Physicians and Surgeons of B.C. has opened the door for psychiatrists to prescribe ketamine for treatment of depression. But Lily Kay Ross, an editor at the drug-focused publication Psymposia, who completed a PhD on social responses to sexual violence, cautions that there is a real danger of coercion in this type of treatment because of the power imbalance and the nature of the substances.

""In therapy, people take drugs to alter their consciousness and enter into a boundary dissolving state,"" she wrote in an email.

""They may report feeling — and even appear — quite lucid, but they are not able to make sound decisions about sexual engagement. And it is a violation of therapeutic trust to engage sexually.""

In a civil claim filed in B.C. Supreme Court in 2018, Buisson alleges she was repeatedly sexually assaulted by Yensen, with Dryer's knowledge, while in treatment with the couple. 

Yensen does not deny having sex with Buisson, but in his response to her lawsuit, he accuses her of initiating it, describing her as ""a skilled manipulator."" He also denies owing her the duty of care inherent in a doctor-patient relationship, suggesting they were merely fellow participants in a research study, albeit with different roles.

The civil claim has since been settled out of court on undisclosed terms, but MAPS has acknowledged that Yensen carried on an ""unethical"" sexual relationship with Buisson and said Dryer knew but failed to report it to any authorities. The organization has cut ties with both Yensen and Dryer.

Neither Yensen nor Dryer responded to requests for comment. Buisson has also sought accountability in other ways. 

She filed a sexual assault complaint with the Quadra Island detachment of the RCMP, who confirmed for CBC that an investigation is ongoing.

She also turned to the professional regulators, filing a complaint against Dryer with the College of Physicians and Surgeons of B.C., which has yet to be resolved after three years.

No recourse when psychotherapy is unregulated
Finally, because Yensen was described as a psychologist on the website for MAPS Canada, Buisson filed a complaint with the College of Psychologists of B.C. 

But it turns out Yensen is not a registered psychologist in this province, so the college had no power to investigate or discipline him. Officials did, however, ask him to stop calling himself a psychologist online, according to a letter provided to CBC. 

There is no regulatory body governing people like Yensen in B.C. As it stands, literally anyone can call themselves a therapist or counsellor and start advertising their services to British Columbians.

In December, the Federation of Associations for Counselling Therapists in B.C. (FACTBC) submitted a formal application to Health Minister Adrian Dix, calling for urgent regulation of the profession. But Dix has now rejected that effort, writing in a Feb. 9 letter that the government won't consider regulation of any new health professions until a new oversight body for health professional colleges is in place.

Glen Grigg, chair of FACTBC, described that decision as ""tragically out of step with the gravity of Ms. Buisson's experience."" In an email, he said lack of regulation was a major factor in what happened to Buisson.

Buisson is disappointed as well.

""Regulation alone is not going to fix the problem. Therapists can be regulated and still be deeply unethical. But the difference is when therapists are regulated and there's oversight and there's a college, patients have some kind of recourse,"" Buisson said.

'MDMA can make patients more vulnerable to sexual pressure'
The allegations against Yensen and Dryer are not outliers in the field of psychedelic therapy, where sexual abuse has long been acknowledged as a potential risk.

In fact, MAPS founder and executive director Rick Doblin wrote in his PhD dissertation that: ""The loving and trusting feelings that can be induced by MDMA can make patients more vulnerable to sexual pressure.""

One of the early American proponents for the use of MDMA in therapy, Richard Ingrasci, was permanently barred from practising psychiatry in 1989 after patients came forward to allege he'd sexually abused them while they were under the influence. Psychiatrist Francesco DiLeo of Maryland had been disciplined for similar violations just two years earlier.

Some doctors, therapists get Health Canada permission to use magic mushrooms
In response to Buisson's experience, MAPS issued a statement in 2019 saying that its policies forbid sexual relationships between therapists and their patients, and ""there was no prior indication that Richard Yensen or Donna Dryer would violate this policy.""

The organization says its lawyers have determined MAPS was not legally responsible for what happened to Buisson, though it agreed to pay her $15,000 for therapy ""on a compassionate basis.""

Since Buisson's experience, MAPS has formalized a Code of Ethics that makes it clear practitioners must ""avoid entering into dual relationships that are likely to lead to impaired professional judgment or exploitation."" The organization has not, however, tightened its policies on who can act as a therapist in clinical trials.

Protective measures including a requirement for two therapy providers to work together on each case were already in place when Buisson began treatment with Yensen and Dryer. MAPS still only requires one member of the team to be licensed, and there are still married couples working together, according to a spokesperson. Buisson is deeply unsatisfied with the response.

""They didn't put the protocols in place to keep the patient safe. After a harm occurred, MAPS has taken no corrective measures to mitigate the harms,"" she said.

She urges anyone who is considering taking part in psychedelic therapy not to buy into the hype about psychedelics as miracle cures for psychological issues and to understand that there are risks as well. She also recommends bringing along a buddy who will stay sober and make sure the situation is safe.

""This is not a safe situation. What that does for patients is it puts us in a position of responsibility for our own care,"" Buisson said.

""Go into it with your eyes open and get informed, get educated."" "
,"N.B. clinic brings psychedelic drug to mainstream to treat PTSD
Social Sharing
",22-Feb-22,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-ptsd-veteran-ketamine-1.6357089,"At his dining room table, Dennis Leblanc clicks through a digital photo album of his time in uniform. With his wife Amanda looking on, he recalls a period of his life filled with purpose and camaraderie.

""I loved it,"" said Leblanc, who lives in Oromocto, near 5th Canadian Division Support Base Gagetown, south of Fredericton. ""I still love it. I could push myself. I knew my limits and capabilities, and then I would surpass them. And that's what I loved about the job so much.""

A veteran of Bosnia in 1999, Haiti in 2004 and then two tours of duty in Afghanistan, Leblanc revelled in the life of a soldier. For all the welcome memories though, there are just as many scars. 

Like so many other Canadian soldiers who deployed to Afghanistan, Leblanc returned a changed man. The brutality and death of a war zone, the loss of comrades and friends, took a heavy toll, and healing was elusive.

Eventually, Leblanc was treated with ketamine, a one-time veterinary anesthetic now being touted as a therapy for post-traumatic stress disorder. Leblanc had been diagnosed with PTSD in 2008 and treated while still in uniform. It was enough to carry him through to the end of his service but cost him his first marriage. 

He returned to civilian life in 2015, after 18 years in the army. But leaving the life he loved brought its own traumas,  reopening old wounds he and his second wife Amanda thought had healed.

""I started having nightmares. I wasn't sleeping well … insomnia, super hyper-vigilant. I was a disaster. I wasn't drinking daily, but I would still, you know, have a good time, and I'd look for it, and I would still use it.

""And at the time, I was on a lot of medications that you're not supposed to drink with. I was not in a good place at all.""

Nothing seemed to help
Amanda could see her husband's deterioration as he struggled to adjust to civilian life.  

""He was really experiencing a complete loss of identity. And yes, he had lost friends. And yes, he had seen traumatic things and he had been through horrible experiences. But losing that part of him was not something that he had anticipated. So things went downhill pretty quickly from there.""

""I was on my way,"" Dennis said quietly. ""At one point in time, to be honest, I was going to hang myself and I ... she yelled out for me, and I stopped … I wouldn't be here without her.""

Prescription medications weren't working, Leblanc said. Always open to alternative options, he tried yoga, meditation, hypnosis, cannabis, exercise. It was clear to both Dennis and Amanda that if he was going to survive, something had to change.

Battlefield drug put to new use
They found a private clinic outside Fredericton, in a former call centre, where rows of sterile cubicles have been replaced with comfortable, overstuffed furnishings.

Soft music and soothing lights create an atmosphere more spa-like than medical. But the people who come here are looking for something stronger than hot yoga.

The recently opened clinic is operated by Field Trip Health, a chain of clinics in the U.S. and Canada that treats PTSD with ketamine.

Ketamine was formulated in the 1960s as an anesthetic. It proved its worth during the Vietnam War and eventually gained favour among veterinarians. Its anti-depressive and hallucinogenic properties popularized its recreational use.

Now ketamine is once again treating battlefield injuries for those wrestling with the ghosts of Afghanistan.

""What these psychedelic-like drugs do is they temporarily suspend the brain's normal thought patterns,"" said Dr. Michael Verbora, medical director of Field Trip Health.  
 ""As you can imagine, someone who's suffering from chronic depression, anxiety or trauma, it is really, really hard to break that cycle of thought. Something like 95 per cent of our thoughts every day are the same. By taking a dose of ketamine and slowly graduating over a number of sessions, what we can do is suspend all those ordinary thoughts.

""And what patients will tell us is for the first time in a very long time, they get a whole new perspective at looking at their life, and it's that new frame of reference or new perspective that starts to initiate a healing process.""

A longtime proponent of cannabinoid therapy to treat PTSD, Verbora is now one in a growing group of doctors promoting hallucinogens for the same purpose.

Ketamine is one of an arsenal of psychedelics once popular as recreational drugs, but now showing more promise treating trauma. It's that promise that brought Dennis Leblanc to Field Trip Health.  

Settled into a stylish lounger, clients are hooked up to a blood pressure monitor.  An eye mask blocks out light, noise-cancelling headphones add to the sense of isolation. A weighted blanket provides further comfort. 

The dose of ketamine is ingested in a lozenge. The resulting trip is brief but impactful.

""It felt like a warm blanket kind of just trickling down over me,"" Leblanc said. ""Like it was just a comforting feeling. I had an eye shade on, the room was black. It wasn't scary. And then immediately I just started falling and I started to kind of like, 'Oh, what is going on?'

""And then, boom, I was 10,000 feet in the air over one of the incidents that occurred in Afghanistan, watching the big picture unfold."" Leblanc said he then started to talking to himself, but to his younger self.

""Like I sat down and said, ""Listen, what do you need to do?' And actually, it was me now, a much older me, saying, 'OK, you need to change some things in your life. You need to smarten up.""'

As the drug wears off, Leblanc is questioned by a psychotherapist about what he experienced. This is the most crucial part of the session, according to Verbora. 

""A lot of these psychedelic drugs, ketamine included, what they do is, in addition to suppressing your normal thought patterns, which can sometimes be very sabotaging and pathological, it opens up this temporary window of maybe five to seven days where the brain enters a learning state.""

That learning state gives therapists an opportunity to delve into the patient's subconscious, using the brain's ability to rebuild neural pathways and in a sense, reroute the subconscious journey around the trauma.

An alternative to usual drug treatments
For Leblanc, the sessions lifted a weight.

""I felt great,"" he said. ""No pain. My mind was clear, like happy. You could have probably sold me a Lamborghini and I would have figured out how to pay for it later. But that's how great I felt.""   

The ketamine sessions offer an alternative to the traditional treatment of PTSD using anti-depressants such as Zoloft, Prozac and Paxil. Often they're being prescribed with other drugs that result in unwelcome side-effects, said Verbora.

""People aren't really healing through these pharmaceutical approaches, and a lot of veterans are taking three, four, five pharmaceuticals, many of which can be very, very addictive. And when we look at the new literature coming out with psychedelics, what we see is the ability to cure people.""

That's a big claim, and not one other scientists are ready to make just yet. 

At Toronto's Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, researchers are impressed by ketamine's potential.  But Dr. Yuliya Knyahnytska is wary of a rush to embrace ketamine as the new panacea.  ""We don't know how it works,"" she said. ""We don't know the population where it results in best results, and we also don't really know whether it's as effective as anything else we have. We have a lot of other antidepressants. We have a lot of other interventions.

""There's no comparability data at this point to compare that ketamine is as effective as most evidence-based treatments. So as exciting as it is, it's not ready for the general distribution to recommend as an evidence based practice for people with mood disorders yet."" Research isn't limited to ketamine. Other hallucinogens, like MDMA, LSD and psilocybin, are also being tested for their ability to disconnect the brain from traumatic experiences. For now Field Trip Health is sticking with ketamine, hoping to expand its use and its clinics, right across the country. 
Founded by a group of Toronto-based doctors and entrepreneurs, the company already has clinics in eight major U.S.  cities. The Lincoln clinic is the second of three outlets in Canada, chosen for its proximity to the military base and the large community of serving and retired military personnel.   

Veteran feels he has a future Treatment isn't cheap. A course of six sessions at Field Trip Health costs about $6,000, and it isn't covered by Medicare.  So far, about 35 clients are being treated at the Lincoln clinic or have already completed the  program.

Aside from being a client, Dennis Leblanc now works with Vanguard Wellness, an agency that refers retired military personnel for mental health therapy. He has no qualms about recommending to others what he feels has worked so well for him.

""Like I know I do have a future,"" Leblanc said. ""I can see like the habits that were negatively affecting me to move forward. The calmer I am, the less pain I have, the less pain I have, the more I can do purposely.

""So I can, you know, take care of myself a lot better, you know, physically, mentally and then also support my family at the same time. ""

,B.C. centre planning clinical trials to treat addiction with hallucinogens,21-Apr-17,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-centre-planning-clinical-trials-to-treat-addiction-with-hallucinogens-1.4079930,"British Columbia's fledgling network for research into drug abuse is planning clinical trials to explore treating opioid addiction and other substance abuse disorders with hallucinogens.

The B.C. Centre on Substance Use will examine the effectiveness of psychedelic drugs to help people battling addiction. One of the organization's lead researchers and directors, Dr. Kenneth Tupper, says the trials are set to begin this year, pending procurement of funding.

""The evidence from renewed research in this area ... is that there's clinical therapeutic potential for drugs like psilocybin, LSD, [and] ayahuasca,"" said Tupper, adding B.C. and Canada are lagging behind in the research field.

Tupper says hallucinogens could play a role in the province's growing opioid crisis, which claimed 120 lives in March alone. The BCCSU was established by the provincial government to explore solutions to the health crisis, as well as enhance addictions research in B.C. Promising research
Psychedelics have long caught the attention of addictions researchers, and numerous clinical trials have shown promising results.

A 2014 study from John Hopkins University, for example, found psilocybin (the active ingredient in magic mushrooms) to be an effective tool to help smokers kick their habit, more than doubling the effectiveness of traditional cessation drugs like varenicline. 

""Canada was once a world leader in this area of research back in the early 1950s and 60s — and we're now kind of lagging behind,"" said Tupper, adding that Canada pioneered the exploration of treating alcoholism with LSD — a treatment mechanism that continues to be studied. ""The BCCSU is well positioned to undertake this kind of research,"" he said. How it works
Tupper says each potential patient will undergo a thorough screening process prior to being admitted into the trial. He says patients with mental illnesses such as schizophrenia or bipolar disorder might not be well suited for treatment.

Once admitted, patients have sessions with a team of therapists who talk them through the experience of taking the medication. Tupper says patients typically have one to three monitored therapy sessions where they ingest the hallucinogen.

""It's often very unremarkable in these sessions themselves. People are usually wearing a blindfold, listening to music, and encouraged to introspect and reflect on their lives,"" said Tupper. But the ""unremarkable"" sessions can encourage subjects to make significant life changes, like overcoming their addictions.

""Therapeutic outcomes ae often correlated with a mystical or a spiritual-type experience. People often have deep insights about themselves and their relationships with others and with God — and sometimes, as a consequence, have significant behavioural changes.""

Life and death
Tupper says patients follow up with clinicians to determine desired health outcomes, and the team works with the individual to reach those goals.

And with all eyes staring at B.C.'s ongoing opioid crisis, Tupper hopes that assisted psychedelic therapy could become part of the solution.

""It's a matter of life of death,"" he said. ""There's an urgent need to explore all different kinds of options and this is one that seems to be very promising."""
,"Some doctors, therapists get Health Canada permission to use magic mushrooms
Social Sharing
",10-Dec-20,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/london/some-doctors-therapists-get-health-canada-permission-to-use-magic-mushrooms-1.5834485,"Four months after it allowed a handful of palliative care patients to use psilocybin as a way to relieve end-of-life suffering, Health Canada has cleared the way for more than a dozen health professionals to use the psychedelic drug themselves to help develop therapies for future use. 

Health Canada says it granted 16 exemptions to a selection of nurses, doctors, therapists and social workers, allowing them to possess and use psilocybin for personal training without fear of prosecution under the country's drug laws. 

""This is not a small step. This is a seismic step,"" said Dr. Sean O'Sullivan, a Tillsonburg, Ont., doctor and medical director of TheraPsil, a non-profit group that advocates for the therapeutic use of psilocybin. 

""This is permission from the Ministry of Health and the Minister of Health to allow therapists to forward their own training in psychedelic medicine.""  The move comes after Health Canada gave four exemptions to palliative care patients to use the drug for end-of-life psychotherapy in August. Since then, other exemptions have been given to patients who want to use magic mushrooms. 

The exemptions for health professionals will allow those who want to treat patients with psilocybin to understand what it would feel like and how best to use it. 

They are good for one year. 

""Psychedelic substances and treatment using these substances, such as psilocybin, is a growing area of scientific study and research. Because psilocybin is not an authorized therapeutic substance, the availability of rigorous scientific evidence demonstrating its safety and efficacy is limited,"" Health Canada said in a statement to CBC News. 

""The exemptions do not permit the health care professionals to prescribe or provide mushrooms containing psilocybin to another person. There are no drugs containing psilocybin that have been authorized  by Health Canada. Health Canada's decision to grant these exemptions does not constitute an opinion or endorsement from Health Canada on psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, training, or the safety, effectiveness, or quality of psilocybin.""

Psychiatrists, nurses given exemptions
""This is an immense step that the minister has taken, and a very wise step, a step that is totally congruent with the science and the published literature and is a very courageous move on her part and on our government's part,"" O'Sullivan said. 

Psychedelic therapies such as psilocybin and LSD have had negative reputations, in part because of the war on drugs, O'Sullivan said.  ""The war on drugs has been an unmitigated disaster worldwide. It has criminalized behaviour that does not need to be criminalized. Cannabis has been legalized, and the sky has not fallen,"" O'Sullivan said. 

Those who have been given exemptions include psychiatrists associated with the University of Toronto, a community psychiatrist in Hamilton and his partner, as well as health professionals in Calgary and British Columbia. 

O'Sullivan and his wife both got an exemption. He is a general practitioner and she is a therapist. He said it's important for doctors who could eventually prescribe psychedelics to be well versed in their effects. ""You would not expect a guide to take any journey over any terrain with which the guide was not familiar. When it comes to psychedelics, the terrain is so unusual and so outlandish that it is absolutely imperative that the therapist have familiarity with the realms of the human unconscious that are visited under psychedelics because they can help guide the patient through situations that might seem utterly bizarre, even psychotic to an untrained therapist,"" O'Sullivan said.

""Great information can be obtained if you dissect and unpack that material that comes up under these medications.""  Psilocybin allows the brain to put away the ""default mode network,"" the part of our brain that worries about taxes and dinner and the shopping list, and dive deeper. ""If you look at your default mode network, you will find that the themes that come up are the same themes that came up last year and the year before and the decade before,"" O'Sullivan said. ""Psychedelics disassemble the default mode network and they allow a person to have new experiences in a carefully controlled clinical setting. When the default mode network is put back together, it's not put back together in the same way as it was previously.""

That's why a single dose of a psychedelic medicine can have more effect than years of talk therapy or medication, he said."
,Psychedelic treatment advocates concerned about lack of information available in N.S.,30-Dec-20,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/psychedelics-treatment-trend-rising-1.5856404,"The co-founder and treasurer of a non-profit organization called the Halifax Psychedelic Society is worried that harm-reduction information around psychedelic drugs might not be a priority in Nova Scotia.

""We think that a lot of people are going to be kind of self-experimenting with psychedelics more as they are becoming more trendy, and with that I think there's a lot of people that don't have the knowledge of what's a safe dose,"" said Justin Andrews.

Andrews helped to establish the society in 2018 with the goal of providing a support system and harm-reduction information to those interested in using psychedelics like psilocybin and LSD for medicinal treatment.

Harm reduction, or harm minimization, refers to strategies to help reduce the harms associated with certain behaviours, both legal and illegal.

In this case, harm reduction would include information about how to take the drugs properly. That could be how much or how little to use, or how to prepare the drugs.

'I have to do this'
As well, it could include tips on how to deal with what is commonly referred to as a ""bad trip"" — an unpleasant experience triggered by psychoactive drugs.

Although Andrews didn't start to take his interest in psychedelic psychotherapy seriously until 2016, when he attended a series of conferences, he said harm reduction has always been a priority to him.

""I've been interested in drug harm reduction my whole life,"" he said. ""I've had friends and family get wrapped up with substance-abuse disorders and, after all the travelling, I just felt a calling. I have to do this.""

Andrews and the society are in favour of the legal use of psychedelics in psychotherapy.

He said he has friends who have had what he describes as mentally transformative experiences. But others have had traumatizing experiences, something he thinks needs more discussion.

""Things can go bad and I don't want people to think this is some silver bullet for depression,"" said Andrews.

'People want this'
He said he's definitely seen a spike in interest when it comes to people seeking information about using psychedelics. He said that is why it's more important than ever to have resources available to Nova Scotians when it comes to harm reduction.

""There is a growing trend of underground therapy,"" said Andrews. ""We're staying as above board as possible with everything, but it is hard.

""People want this. People are excited about the healing potential which is why I stress that people understand the politics and policy behind these things."" The Nova Scotia Health Authority doesn't offer any harm-reduction literature in regard to psychedelics unless it's part of an addiction-treatment plan.

Jeff Toth, a psychiatric nurse, the society's president and a harm-reduction advocate, said recent studies have identified the therapeutic benefits of psychedelics such as psilocybin, LSD  and MDMA to treat post-traumatic stress disorder, depression and addiction. But he said more research is needed.

""Some people are calling this the psychedelic renaissance in terms of the amount of research coming out,"" said Toth. ""The evidence thus far is considered preliminary and additional evidence will need to be collected.""

Use in treatment touted
Toth supports the use of psychedelics for treatment.

He said his interest was prompted by seeing just how many people with PTSD aren't able to find relief through usual means.  A study done by the British Journal of Psychiatry ranks Canada as having the highest prevalence of PTSD of the 24 countries included in the study.

Toth adds that mental health problems like PTSD are among some of the only cases in the health field where it's acceptable for people to receive inconsistent and even ineffective treatment.

""If heart transplants only worked about half the time that would be a big problem,"" said Toth. ""There's a lot of people out there who are suffering and that conventional treatments aren't working and this could be a potential avenue for people to have access to healing.""

Although there is still more work to be done in terms of testing, said Toth, things are still looking promising right now.

Andrews said the group in no way supports or aids people in gaining access to psychedelics since they are illegal in Nova Scotia. However, he said the group will continue to provide information about how to safely take psychedelics for those unable or unwilling to stop using. 

NSHA response
""We do not have any imminent plans to release harm reduction literature pertinent to the therapeutic use of psychedelics as we have not come across a high demand for this to date,"" Dr. Samuel Hickcox, with NSHA's mental health and addictions department, said in an email.

""Our priorities remain focused on reducing the harms associated with substance use disorders by offering a spectrum of treatment interventions for individuals seeking help. This spectrum includes the provision of harm reduction advice.""

Andrews recalls a good friend of his who now lives a somewhat reclusive lifestyle due to his bad experiences with psychedelics and lack of peer support, something he thinks could have been avoided had proper harm-reduction information been available to him.

""As much as I'm in it for the promising research I'm also in it for all the people that have to keep those [bad] experiences quiet. So they can feel heard and they know that people are there for them."""
,Edmonton company to produce psychedelic drugs for clinical use,23-Feb-21,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/edmonton/mushrooms-drugs-clinic-medical-edmonton-1.5924035,"A new Edmonton-based company is planning to grow magic mushrooms for potential use in medical clinics. 

Dr. Peter Silverstone, a long-time faculty member with the department of psychiatry at the University of Alberta, is hoping to facilitate access to the psychedelic drug through his new company, PsiloTec Health Solutions.

In a release, the company bills itself as the first fully integrated psychedelic drug development company in North America. 

The company is currently in the process of securing a 23,000 square-foot facility to produce psilocybin in the Edmonton area.

Silverstone says psychedelic drugs could be a new option for people who are struggling with severe mental health issues who have been unable to find relief through currently available therapies. ""It's a combination of talk therapy and psychedelics,"" Silverstone said. ""It's not just a bag of mushrooms. With those combinations there have been some striking results.""

Psilocybin, the active drug in magic mushrooms, has shown promise in relieving end-of-life distress for palliative cancer patients, though it is still undergoing clinical trials.

Silverstone said psilocybin is a low-risk drug but it is important to ensure those undergoing treatments are safe and supported.

""Certainly I am not advocating that people get high doses of anything and then go home and take them. I think we need to figure out for individuals what is the risk-benefit."" Since August 2020, Health Canada has granted exemptions under subsection 56(1) of the CDSA to a number of patients to possess and consume mushrooms containing psilocybin, while undergoing psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, for the treatment of end-of-life anxiety and psychological distress associated with a cancer diagnosis. One Calgary company has already been approved by Health Canada to conduct legal psychedelic-assisted therapy for patients in palliative care. 

On Sunday doctors with the ATMA Journey Centers guided their second patient through a treatment session according to its co-CEO, David Harder. 

""Most people don't fit the criteria right now that Health Canada has set up,"" Harder said.

""Once [approved] we have a psychiatrist, doctors, nurses, psychologists. Depending on the situation, if it's palliative care then obviously we work more with the palliative care doctor. If it's more mental health we would work more with the psychologists and psychiatrists."" Health Canada's Special Access Program (SAP) enables drugs that have not yet been approved as marketed drugs to be requested by practitioners for the treatment, diagnosis, or prevention of serious or life-threatening conditions in instances where conventional therapies have failed, are unsuitable, or unavailable.

Recently, Health Canada consulted on a proposal to reverse the regulatory amendments made in 2013 and restore potential access to restricted drugs through the SAP. 

Currently Health Canada is considering feedback on the consultation, though in the interim, access to restricted drugs through the SAP remains prohibited.

The proposed amendments are not intended to bypass the well-established clinical trial and drug review process, nor to promote or encourage the early use of unapproved drugs.

Harder hopes to one day be allowed to use psychedelic treatments to treat depression, anxiety and possibly even post-traumatic stress disorder.

Harder said he's also noticed a major shift in attitudes toward psychedelics as a treatment option.

""I couldn't get doctors, nurses, psychiatrists, psychologists to talk to me a year ago and now it is overwhelming.""

Founder of Multidisciplinary Associations for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) Canada, Mark Haden, said he's also noticed a change in attitudes. 

""I started MAPS Canada in 2011,"" Haden said. ""I had a couple of doctors who whispered in the corridor that they were interested … and ten years later I have about 60 on my list who are eagerly enthusiastic to get involved. Both from a research perspective and also providing the treatment.""

Haden also credits the legalization of cannabis with helping move the process along. 

""Politicians who just talk about the evidence seem to be supported. So, the politics and the taboo and the stigma around drug policy generally, but certainly around psychedelics is being reduced as well."""
,Sask. man first in Canada to legally use magic mushrooms in therapy,26-Aug-20,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/saskatchewan/thomas-hartle-magic-mushroom-psilocybin-therapy-1.5700371,"A Saskatchewan man has completed Canada's first legal psilocybin therapy. 

Psilocybin is the active ingredient in what are commonly known as magic mushrooms. 

""The experience was not anywhere near as overwhelming as my anxiety had feared it could be,"" Thomas Hartle said.

Hartle has Stage 4 terminal colon cancer. The 52-year-old Saskatoon father-of-two was diagnosed in 2016 and has been through multiple rounds of chemotherapy and radiation treatment before his cancer came back in August 2019. Hartle wanted something to help manage his anxieties about death. He found psilocybin therapy studies by John Hopkins University where the drug was combined with music and psychological counselling.

Hartle wrote the federal Ministry of Controlled Substances. In early August, he was granted a federal exemption to legally try the therapy for end-of-life care. 

""I've had two weeks to kind of digest my experience,"" Hartle said. ""Overall I have found myself to really just be not thinking about a lot of the things that had been previously causing me anxiety."" To prepare, Hartle spent sessions building trust and expectations with Dr. Bruce Tobin. Tobin is the main doctor with TheraPsil, an advocacy group for psilocybin therapy.

Hartle and Tobin met in Saskatoon and talked about Hartle's anxiety and depression levels before the therapy session. Then Hartle took the psilocybin dose, put on a blindfold and waited for it to work.

Hartle took three capsules — which totalled about seven grams of dried mushrooms — spaced out throughout the day while listening to music.

""It was a very, what we call, synesthesia experience for me,"" Hartle said. ""Synesthesia is where one sense will cross with another sense. You can smell a colour or hear a smell or something like that.""

He said each different type fo music he listened to put him into ""a different universe.""

""It was very serene and peaceful."" After that Hartle, his close friend John and Dr. Tobin sat together in Hartle's guest bedroom. 

""What's really important about this process is setting,"" Hartle said. ""It has to be someplace where you feel safe and secure.""

They talked about a variety of topics, including Hartle's anxieties. Hartle said it was about seven hours from the first dose until he was ""grounded"" again.

Now, Hartle said his anxiety doesn't affect him in the same way. 

""If I find my head getting cluttered up with thoughts, it's really much easier for me right now to find that same quiet place that I experienced,"" Hartle said. 

""Things that would normally have caused me some emotional distress … now they really don't have the same sharp corners and edges that they used to."" Hartle used to worry about his anxiety pulling him away from his family, because he didn't want them seeing him in his anxious state. After the therapy, Hartle said he's just trying to be with them in the present. 

""I don't make plans for the future but they're not consuming me in a negative way now,"" Hartle said. ""I'm pleased with the outcome."" John Hopkins University is still experimenting with the therapy. Hartle said he doesn't know whether others will have the same access he had, but he hopes that sharing his story might make others may look into it. 

""What I had experienced was better than what I had hoped it would be."""
,Airdrie patient with terminal cancer 1st Albertan to legally take magic mushroom treatment,12-Jan-21,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/calgary/alberta-first-magic-mushrooms-legal-patient-1.5869447,"Terminal cancer patient Tony White is the first Albertan to have undergone legal psychedelic therapy in Canada since Health Canada started allowing palliative care patients to take magic mushrooms to relieve end-of-life distress last year.

White, who is from Airdrie, says he doesn't remember much from his magic mushroom trip on Jan. 1, other than the feeling it left him with.

""I just was lying there and I felt like I couldn't be at more peace then, right then and there,"" said White.

White, who is in his 40s, has been struggling with anxiety and depression ever since he learned his cancer was incurable.

His partner says it's been hard to watch White lose his zest for life.

""He went from being Mr. Happy-go-lucky, everybody knows him, to being isolated at home with this terminal illness,"" said Rebecca Crewe.

But the couple say after White took psilocybin, under a psychiatrist's care, his outlook, demeanour, and even his body language changed — becoming lighter and more open.

""He's laughing. He's smiling. He has a sense of humour, he's affectionate again,"" said Crewe. ""It's been life changing.""

Fight the stigma
The Calgary-based company Atma Journey Centres helped White facilitate his application and treatment. It's the first legal treatment the company has been involved with.

Company cofounder David Harder said he's heard the snickers and seen the raised eyebrows when he talks about the medical benefits of magic mushrooms and other psychedelics. But, he said there's growing scientific research out there to back up those claims. 

""Twenty years from now, we're going to look back and go, how do we think that these were bad? Like if they're done properly, if they're done respectfully, these can be the greatest asset we have to help us with this mental health crisis that we're facing,"" said Harder.

He said this type of therapy can take people on a journey into the unknown, to explore their fears and anxieties, in a safe environment.

""What is beyond when we die? Nobody knows. So with the psychedelic it kind of gives you a glimpse past the curtain and lets you see what's going on and it takes the fear out of it,"" said Harder.  Psilocybin, the active drug in magic mushrooms, has shown promise in relieving end-of-life distress for palliative cancer patients, but it's still undergoing clinical trials that are necessary before it can be made widely available to the public.

Since August 2020, Health Canada has granted 20 exemptions to patients diagnosed with cancer to treat their end-of-life distress. 

Harder said there is a screening process as part of the exemption application. He said each case may vary but generally the participant undergoes counselling sessions before and afterward. And, he said there are a couple of people on hand during the four-to-five-hour psychedelic experience, including a therapist, psychologist or psychiatrist 

""It's part of a protocol, it's not just a 'go to the forest, do a trip and see what happens,'"" said Harder.

Passionate about helping others
White says he went in without any expectations and an open mind. Crewe says it was such a good experience that the couple wanted to share their story with others.

""I've seen so many physical, spiritual, emotional changes. It's been truly inspiring and incredible. And it's, if I can speak on behalf of both of us, it just makes us even more passionate about getting this to other patients that are in Tony's situation,"" said Crewe.

Harder believes magic mushrooms could one day be used more broadly to treat a variety of mental health disorders such as PTSD. 

""Because even for palliative care clients, patients, it's the mental aspect of the fear of death, anxiety and all those things that settle in in this palliative diagnosis, so those are the things we're addressing,"" said Harder.

Currently Health Canada approves magic mushrooms on a case-by-case basis, for palliative care patients only.

Health Canada has also granted 18 exemptions to a selection of nurses, doctors, therapists and social workers, allowing them to possess and use psilocybin for personal training without fear of prosecution under the country's drug laws. 

The exemptions for health professionals will allow those who want to treat patients with psilocybin to understand what it would feel like and how best to use it. The exemptions are good for one year."
,B.C. health researchers harness the 'magic' of psychedelic mushrooms,21-Jun-21,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/b-c-companies-psychedelics-mental-health-1.6070510,"After beating what doctors told her was terminal cancer, Mona Strelaeff had hoped her health complications were behind her.

Instead, what followed were years of crippling depression and anxiety.

At the centre of her mental health struggle: childhood trauma, and the continued fear of her own mortality.

She sought an array of pharmaceutical treatments in Canada and the U.S., but none yielded any desired results.

""I've been on all kinds of [anti-depressants],"" she said. ""I would have terrible side effects, or they would take me to the extreme — I would cry all the time, or I wouldn't sleep.""

That was until last November, when she received federal approval for psilocybin-assisted ­ther­­­apy. Psilocybin is the psychedelic component within magic mushrooms.

She says she dove deep into a psychedelic experience, where she revisited her childhood, and came to terms with many demons of the past. ""When [the doctor] gave me the treatment and I came out of it in a place of peace,"" she said. ""My anxiety was basically gone. And to this day I still feel at peace. I'm not afraid of death.""

Psychedelics are a growing area of exploration within the mental health field, and Health Canada has approved clinical trials measuring their efficacy. A handful of B.C. companies are at the forefront of administering treatments, and researching ways to make them more accessible.

Banking on breakthroughs
For Payton Nyquvest, psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy was a last-ditch effort to remedy severe chronic pain and the depression that came along with it.

""The Western health-care system just couldn't rectify what was going on,"" he said.

Nyquvest is the founder of Numinus, a B.C.-based publicly traded company specializing in psychedelic research, production, and distribution. It's one of the few companies with a Health Canada licence to do so.

Later this summer, Numinus is expected to complete a clinical trial on a psilocybin extract it has developed. Dr. Evan Wood is the company's chief medical officer. He took a leave of absence from his post at the B.C. Centre for Substance Use to assume the role. ""In addition to assessing safety, that study will also be measuring the psychedelic effects in terms of the type of experience that it brings about in people that are healthy,"" said Wood.

Wood points to other studies as reasons to be optimistic, including work at Johns Hopkins University that showed psilocybin as an effective treatment for both depression and tobacco addiction.

""It's very much a paradigm shift and really, I think the most exciting area in mental health and addiction right now,"" he said. Wood says the jury is still out, however, when it comes to the benefits of micro-dosing psychedelics — taking a minimal dosage that doesn't cause hallucinations to improve health. Advocates contend that small doses can boost mood and creativity, however research hasn't ruled out whether it's due to a placebo effect.

Dispensaries emerging
Proponents like Evans and Payton are hopeful psychedelic drugs are on the same trajectory as cannabis when it comes to widespread medicinal use.

And, similar to cannabis prior to federal legalization, illegal dispensaries in Vancouver are open for business. Longtime marijuana advocate Dana Larsen is among those who have set up shop.

""Psilocybin mushrooms really remind me now where the cannabis movement was in maybe the mid-'90s,"" he said. ""There's just starting to be increasing public awareness about the tremendous medicinal benefits of using these mushrooms."" Larsen's shop sells micro-doses of psilocybin, as well as macro-doses for those who can prove they have a medical need.

Despite operating illegally, Larsen says police rarely intervene in Vancouver, similar to how pot dispensaries were treated for years.

He says it's because they fill a void in the health-care system. His dispensary is in the Downtown Eastside where many residents suffer from homelessness, mental health disorders, and substance use.

""I serve a lot of members who are currently taking anti-depressants — and don't like being on those anti-depressants,"" said Larsen.

He hopes it's only a matter of time before shops like his become widespread.

""I hope that a few years from now, we see dozens, if not hundreds of these kinds of places in cities and towns across Canada."""
,4 dying Canadians wait to hear if they'll be allowed to try magic mushrooms for their anguish,19-Jul-20,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/4-dying-canadians-wait-to-hear-if-they-ll-be-allowed-to-try-magic-mushrooms-for-their-anguish-1.5653083,"It's been about three months since four dying Canadians filed applications with the federal government asking for the right to try magic mushrooms to treat the psychological distress that comes with facing the end of their lives.

The psychedelic fungi have shown promise in relieving some of the anxiety and depression faced by those suffering with terminal cancer, but the active ingredient psilocybin is still undergoing clinical trials.

Victoria psychotherapist Bruce Tobin, founder of the advocacy group TheraPsil, says completing those trials is absolutely necessary before magic mushrooms can be made widely available.

But he believes terminally ill patients deserve compassionate access to something that might help with their anguish when other treatments have failed.

""Canadian society now acknowledges that citizens have the right to die,"" Tobin told CBC News, referring to the legalization of medical assistance in dying.

""How is it that we're going to allow them to die when they affirm that their lives are intolerable, but we won't acknowledge their right to try something that could allow them to continue their life in a meaningful way?"" Research is currently underway to determine if psilocybin is safe and effective to treat things like depression, obsessive compulsive disorder and substance use disorder. Two studies published in 2016 suggest that treatment with psilocybin can produce significant and lasting improvements in depression and anxiety for cancer patients.

'I'm so scared and angry'
TheraPsil has helped the four cancer patients file Section Section 56 applications under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act to obtain psilocybin. The law gives the health minister the power to grant access to illegal drugs when ""necessary for a medical or scientific purpose or is otherwise in the public interest.""

In a video filmed by TheraPsil, Laurie Brooks, an Abbotsford nurse and mother of four, describes the feelings she's experienced since learning her cancer is terminal.

""I'm so scared and angry, and I feel guilty and ashamed that I'm putting my family through this,"" she tells the camera.

Brooks, who was not available for an interview with CBC, says she learned about the potential therapeutic uses of psilocybin from a documentary, and she was struck by a fellow cancer patient who ""looked so peaceful"" after receiving the drug. The patients have yet to receive a response. A Health Canada spokesperson said in an email that she was unable to comment on individual applications, but the length of each review depends on the complexity of the case and the completeness of the application.

""The Government of Canada has great empathy for individuals living with a terminal illness and their needs for care and treatment. Health Canada is committed to carefully and thoroughly reviewing each ... request relating to psilocybin on a case-by-case basis,"" the spokesperson said. Health Canada also has a special access program that allows practitioners to request access to drugs that aren't currently available in this country ""for treating patients with serious or life-threatening conditions when conventional treatments have failed, are unsuitable or are unavailable.""

""It would seem that that program was tailor made for both psilocybin and for the patients that we seek to treat,"" Tobin said.

But restricted drugs like psilocybin aren't available through the program, a stipulation that Tobin describes as ""arbitrary and unscientific.""

Previous application rejected
Three years ago, Tobin applied for a more sweeping exemption from Canadian law that would allow him to use psilocybin to treat any terminal cancer patient suffering from end-of-life distress so severe it interferes with other medical treatments and that hasn't responded to other available therapies.

Health Canada rejected his application in a letter on March 3, saying that there is ""insufficient evidence"" to support an exemption, and that ""psilocybin can be accessed through other means"" — specifically, through clinical trials.

Tobin disagrees with that assessment and plans to officially dispute it.

He points to a 2015 decision from the Supreme Court of Canada that struck down restrictions on the use of non-dried forms of medical cannabis. That judgment states that ""by forcing a person to choose between a legal but inadequate treatment and an illegal but more effective one, the law ... infringes security of the person.""

Tobin remains hopeful that the federal government will grant the patients' requests for psilocybin, but if it doesn't happen, TheraPsil plans to file a constitutional challenge.

""I'm going to be saddened to see my government's health minister be in a position of denying dying people something that there's evidence to show could be helpful for them,"" he said."
