Fox News,"Michigan city decriminalizes magic mushrooms, other psychedelic plants",23-Sep-20,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/michigan-city-decriminalizes-magic-mushrooms-other-psychedelic-plants,"The Ann Arbor, Mich., City Council unanimously voted this week to essentially decriminalize a wide range of psychedelic drugs, including psilocybin mushrooms, mescaline, and ayahuasca.

""The Mayor and City Council hereby declare that it shall be the policy of the City of Ann Arbor that the investigation and arrest of persons for planting, cultivating, purchasing, transporting, distributing, engaging in practices with, or possessing Entheogenic Plants or plant compounds which are on the Federal Schedule 1 list shall be the lowest law enforcement priority for the City of Ann Arbor,"" the resolution passed Monday says.

The resolution applies to ""plants, fungi, and natural materials ... that can benefit psychological and physical wellness.""

Much of the resolution is framed around the potential for psychedelic plants to treat disorders such as ""substance abuse, addiction, recidivism, trauma, post-traumatic stress symptoms, chronic depression, severe anxiety, end-of-life anxiety, grief, cluster headaches, and other debilitating conditions.""

DENVER NARROWLY VOTES TO DECRIMINALIZE 'MAGIC MUSHROOMS'

Jeff Hayner, a city council member who co-sponsored the resolution, reiterated the therapeutic benefits of these drugs Tuesday.

""It has been my understanding that psilocybin, for instance, shows great potential for treating addictions to alcohol, cocaine, and nicotine,"" Hayner told Fox News. ""It also has been used to treat depression, OCD, migraines and cluster headaches, and has especially been used to deal with recognition of end of life issues, terminal illnesses. We had a caller last night saying that using mushrooms saved his life from serious depression, it was the only thing that helped him, very moving."" OCASIO-CORTEZ WANTS TO MAKE IT EASIER TO STUDY MAGIC MUSHROOMS, OTHER PSYCHEDELIC DRUGS

Numerous studies have demonstrated the therapeutic potential of certain psychedelic drugs.

""High-dose psilocybin produced large decreases in clinician- and self-rated measures of depressed mood and anxiety, along with increases in quality of life, life meaning, and optimism, and decreases in death anxiety,"" a 2016 study in the Journal of Psychopharmacology found.

Researchers at NYU Langone Medical Center found in a separate 2016 study that when cancer patients took a single dose of psilocybin mushrooms, depression and anxiety decreased for months at a time.

“Our results represent the strongest evidence to date of a clinical benefit from psilocybin therapy, with the potential to transform care for patients with cancer-related psychological distress,"" lead researcher Dr. Stephen Ross said in a news release.

Ann Arbor City Council Member Zachary Ackerman pointed out during Monday night's meeting that the future is bright for psychedelic research.

""This is a serious topic with potentially serious benefits,"" Ackerman said. ""To give some perspective, Johns Hopkins, a premier medical research university, just launched a $17 million research center dedicated exclusively to researching the medical benefits of these substances, because Johns Hopkins and their donors see the tremendous potential of these future medicines.""

OAKLAND BECOMES 2ND US CITY TO DECRIMINALIZE MAGIC MUSHROOMS 

Decriminalize Nature Ann Arbor, the group that helped usher the resolution through the Ann Arbor City Council, also cites American liberty and personal freedom in arguing for the decriminalization of psychedelic plants.

""Human beings and American citizens have an unalienable natural right to use plants of their choice,"" the group explains on its website.

Critics of the measure worry that the drugs could end up in the hands of kids or lead to other dangerous scenarios. The resolution attempts to address these concerns by saying it does not authorize ""commercial sales or manufacturing of these plants and fungi, possessing or distributing these materials in schools, driving under the influence of these materials, or public disturbance.""

Ann Arbor is following the lead of other U.S. cities that have legalized psilocybin mushrooms, including Denver, and Oakland and Santa Cruz in California.

Oregon Public Broadcasting reports that Oregon residents will vote in November on an initiative to allow the therapeutic use of psilocybin in the state. It would make Oregon the first state in America to legalize some use of the drug.

Fox News,"Magic mushrooms could help treat depression, study finds",5-Nov-20,https://www.foxnews.com/health/magic-mushrooms-could-help-treat-depressions-study,"This treatment could work like magic.

A new study has found that just two doses of magic mushrooms – and a sprinkle of psychotherapy – can put depression into remission, and could work even better than current antidepressants. Researchers from Johns Hopkins Medicine found that about half the patients in their study saw relief after taking the psychedelic psilocybin, according to the findings published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry.

“The magnitude of the effect we saw was about four times larger than what clinical trials have shown for traditional antidepressants on the market,” said Dr. Alan Davis, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine adjunct assistant professor and study co-author.  There were 24 participants in the study, all of whom had a long-term history of depression and were given two doses of psilocybin over different periods of time. During their monitored trips, participants wore eyeshades and listened to music through headphones while lying on a couch for about five hours – a shockingly short amount of time to have such profound effects, considering how long current depression treatments take.

A week after their second trip, about two-thirds of participants had an over 50% reduction in their depression symptoms. After four weeks, 54% of participants no longer qualified as being depressed.

“Because most other depression treatments take weeks or months to work and may have undesirable effects, this could be a game-changer if these findings hold up in future ‘gold-standard’ placebo-controlled clinical trials,” said Davis. This is far from the first study to find evidence that magic mushrooms may be hugely beneficial to mental health, although it stands out for the massively significant positive changes it reported in participants.

Ketamine, another drug with hallucinogenic effects and a reputation for recreational abuse, has also had a renaissance as a depression treatment.

The magic mushroom study’s release coincides with Oregon becoming the first state to legalize the hallucinogen for therapy – and decriminalize small amounts of all street drugs. This week, Washington, D.C., also voted to decriminalize the far-out ‘shrooms."
Fox News,Push to legalize psychedelic mushrooms in Oregon picks up steam,29-Jun-20,https://www.foxnews.com/us/push-to-legalize-psychedelic-mushrooms-in-oregon-picks-up-steam,"A petition to give voters in Oregon the option to legalize psychedelic mushrooms has garnered enough signatures to be put on the November ballot, organizers said Monday.

The Oregon Psilocybin Therapy Initiative and campaign for Initiative Petition #34 said it gathered 164,782 signatures, according to its website.

""Oregonians now have a legitimate shot to give true access to licensed psilocybin therapy,"" the campaign said in a statement.

The signatures will have to be verified before it qualifies for the ballot.  The campaign said they should know if its approved by mid-July, The Oregonian reported. if approved by voters, the measure would legalize psychedelic mushrooms in controlled doses and would only be administered by professionals.

It would make Oregon the first state to legalize the substance, according to the newspaper. Oakland, Calif., and Denver have already decriminalized psilocybin.

“Pioneering research at institutions like Johns Hopkins, NYU, and UCLA has shown the significant promise of psilocybin therapy,” the campaign said in a press release. Under the measure, people would not be allowed to grow psychedelic mushrooms and only license-holders would be able to provide psilocybin therapy.

“Oregon has some of the highest rates of depression, anxiety, and addiction in the country,” Sheri Eckert, a chief petitioner, said in the release, according to the newspaper. “As a therapist, I am intimately aware of how mental health affects our communities -- not only people suffering from mental health conditions but their families and loved ones as well."""
Fox News,Detroit residents voting on whether to decriminalize 'magic mushrooms' and other psychedelic drugs,2-Nov-21,https://www.foxnews.com/us/detroit-residents-voting-on-whether-to-decriminalize-magic-mushrooms-and-other-psychedelic-drugs,"Detroit could be the latest big city to decriminalize ""magic mushrooms"" and other psychedelics drugs as residents take to the polls Tuesday. 

Voters will be asked under proposal E: ""Shall the voters of the City of Detroit adopt an ordinance to the 2019 Detroit City Code that would decriminalize to the fullest extent permitted under Michigan law the personal possession and therapeutic use of Entheogenic Plants by adults and make the personal possession and therapeutic use of Entheogenic Plants by adults the city's lowest law-enforcement priority?""

About 40 miles west of Detroit, the city council in Ann Arbor, home to the University of Michigan, unanimously voted to decriminalize a wide range of psychedelic drugs last year. 
Several other big cities throughout the United States have also decriminalized psychedelics, including Seattle, Denver, Washington, D.C., Oakland, and Santa Cruz. 

Entheogenic plants – which include drugs such as psilocybin mushrooms, mescaline, and ayahuasca – are described in proposal E as ""the full spectrum of plants, fungi, and natural materials and/or their extracted compounds, limited to those containing the following types of compounds: indole amines, tryptamines, and phenethylamines.""  ""While the DEA considers them to have a potential for abuse, others believe them to have medicinal value for treatment of depression and pain and other maladies, religious significance, and accompanied by a low propensity for abuse,"" the proposal reads. 

The plants are difficult to study because they are federally classified as schedule 1 drugs, but some researchers have found that psilocybin mushrooms could reduce depression and anxiety in cancer patients, MDMA could reduce symptoms of PTSD, and LSD could help treat alcoholism.  Harvard Law School launched the Project on Psychedelics Law and Regulation this summer to examine the legal framework around psychedelic research. 

""Preliminary research suggests that psychedelics could hold major benefits for people experiencing trauma and post-traumatic stress disorder,"" Harvard Law professor Jeannie Suk Gersen said in a statement. 

""By analyzing social, legal, and political barriers to access in this context, we hope to advance the understanding of their potential impact as therapeutics.""

A spokesperson for the Detroit Police Department told Fox News that they ""have not taken a position on the ordinance at this time."" Wayne County Prosecutor Kym Worthy did not respond to a request for comment on Tuesday. 

In September, state Senator Adam Hollier of Detroit and Jeff Irwin of Washtenaw County introduced a bill that would decriminalize psychedelic drugs statewide.

Fox News,"Ocasio-Cortez wants to make it easier to study magic mushrooms, other psychedelic drugs",9-Jun-19,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/ocasio-cortez-introduces-amendment-to-make-it-easier-to-study-magic-mushrooms-and-other-psychedelic-drugs,"Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., filed legislation on Friday to make it easier for researchers to study the therapeutic and medical benefits of certain psychedelic drugs such as magic mushrooms amid a growing national shift in attitudes toward the substances.

In an amendment to a large-scale appropriations bill, Ocasio-Cortez wants to end the rider that prohibits federal money being spent on ""any activity that promotes the legalization of any drug or other substance in Schedule I"" of the Controlled Substances Act.

""Academics and scientists report that provisions like this create [stigma] and insurmountable logistical hurdles to researching Schedule I drugs,"" her summary states.

While certain entheogenic substances – such as mushrooms and peyote – have been used for centuries by Native American communities, the drugs were widely made illegal across the globe during the 1960s and 1970s. The tide, however, seems to be turning on these substances amid research at numerous universities into their efficacy in treating mental health issues and addiction.  In an analysis published last October in an issue of Neuropharmacology, a medical journal focused on neuroscience, researchers from Johns Hopkins University recommended that psilocybin be reclassified for medical use – arguing its benefits in helping treat PTSD, depression and anxiety and helping people stop smoking.

“In the 1960s, they were on the cutting edge of neuroscience research and understanding how the brain worked,” Matthew Johnson, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins, told the New York Times. “But then it got out of the lab.”Johnson added that as the substances gain more mainstream acceptance for their medical uses, it could be a game changer for treating mental illness.

“I see this as a new era in medicine,” he said. “The data suggests that psychedelics are powerful behavioral agents.”

Ocasio-Cortez’s amendment comes on the heels on two major U.S. cities decriminalizing psilocybin, the psychedelic compound found in certain mushrooms. In early May, voters in Denver passed a measure that makes the personal use and possession of psilocybin mushrooms by those 21 years of age or older Denver's ""lowest law-enforcement priority,"" according to the measure's language. It does not legalize psilocybin or permit its sale by Denver's cannabis businesses.

And last Tuesday, the Oakland City Council passed a resolution to decriminalize psilocybin mushrooms. The vote makes the investigation and arrest of adults who grow, possess, use or distribute entheogenic plants one of the lowest priorities for police. No city funds could be used to enforce laws criminalizing the substances, and the Alameda County district attorney would stop prosecuting people who have been apprehended for use or possession.

“Entheogenic plants and fungi are tremendous for helping to enable healing, particularly for folks who have experienced trauma in their lives,” Carlos Plazola, chair of the advocacy group Decriminalize Nature Oakland, said before the council meeting. “These plants are being recommended pretty extensively undercover, underground, by doctors and therapists.” An additional amendment to the appropriations bill, filed by Rep. Lou Correa, D-Calif., would prevent the Department of Education from denying federal funding to any university or college that permits the use or possession of medical marijuana in states where it has been legalized.

While it is unclear whether either of these two riders will clear the Democratically-controlled House, Rules Committee Chairman James McGovern, D-Mass., has been a frequent critic of past Republican efforts to block marijuana-related amendments.

“I’m not going to block marijuana amendments like my predecessor has done,"" McGovern said last year, according to Forbes. ""As chairman of the Rules Committee, I’m not going to block marijuana amendments. People ought to bring them to the floor, they should be debated and people ought to vote the way they feel appropriate.”"
Fox News,"Trump, Biden to share ballot with magic mushrooms, sex education, and Confederate flag",1-Nov-20,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/trump-biden-share-ballot-magic-mushrooms-sex-education-confederate-flag,"This year, President Donald Trump and Democratic nominee Joe Biden will not be all that Americans cast their vote for on ballots.

In 32 states, Americans will decide on a slew of propositions ranging from the therapeutic use of “magic mushrooms,” to comprehensive sex education in public schools to whether to keep the Confederate emblem on Mississippi’s state flag. 

In Oregon, where marijuana is legal, voters will decide whether to allow the regulated medical use of psilocybin – the naturally occurring psychedelic compound produced in so-called “magic mushrooms.” Advocates say the chemical has shown positive benefits for patients with mental health issues. But some, like the American Psychiatric Association, say the controversial practice shouldn’t be decided by ballot initiative, according to The New York Post.  In New Jersey, Arizona, Montana, and South Dakota, residents will vote on whether to approve the adult recreational use of marijuana – which is already legal in 11 states.

A “yes” vote on New Jersey’s Public Question 1 supports a “constitutional amendment to legalize the possession and use of marijuana for persons age 21 and older and legalize the cultivation, processing, and sale of retail marijuana.”

California has 12 propositions on the ballot. Among its most consequential is Proposition 22, a “no” vote of which would reclassify gig workers – like app-based rideshare drivers – as employees rather than independent contracts. The measure has been met with fierce opposition from Uber, Lyft, and DoorDash, Instacart, Lyft, and Postmates. Also in ""The Golden State,"" Proposition16, would if passed, repeal another proposition that outlawed affirmative action in the public sector. Proposition 21 would allow local governments to enact rent control on certain homes and units.

Further north, in Washington state, voters will decide whether its public schools should provide comprehensive sex education while giving parents the option to decide to opt-out their kids. In Mississippi, voters will decide whether to adopt a new design for their state flag that replaces its old one that includes a Confederate battle emblem. The issue – of Mississippi being the last state to feature the symbol – gained media attention this summer as U.S. protests against racial injustice forced to state lawmakers to reckon with the racist history of the Confederate flag."
Fox News,New you: Personality may change after therapy,18-Jan-17,https://www.foxnews.com/health/new-you-personality-may-change-after-therapy,"Personality, once thought to be fundamental and resistant to change, can shift in response to therapy, new research finds.

The study synthesizes data from 207 published research papers that measured personality traits as one outcome of various psychotherapies. Though most of the research was observational rather than experimental, the review, which was published on Jan. 5 in the journal Psychological Bulletin, adds new weight to the idea that personality is not static .

But that doesn't mean that personality change is easy, warned study researcher Brent Roberts, a social and personality psychologist at the University of Illinois.

""For the people who want to change their spouse tomorrow, which a lot of people want to do, I don't hold out much hope for them,"" Roberts said. However, he continued, ""if you're willing to focus on one aspect of yourself, and you're willing to go at it systematically, there's now increased optimism that you can affect change in that domain."" Previous research has found that the ""big five"" personality traits — openness to experience, conscientiousness , extraversion , agreeableness and neuroticism — are predictive of success in life.

And much research has suggested that these traits are stable. For example, one 2010 study showed that people's personalities were relatively stable from first grade to adulthood , and that a first grader's personality could predict his or her adult behavior, the review said. People who were impulsive as kids were likely to be talkative and expansive in their interests as adults, while those who were more restrained as children grew up to be more insecure and timid.

Studies such as that one have led some researchers to view personality as basically immutable. But other scientists have challenged that notion, including Roberts in his own research. For example, he and his colleagues found that people become more conscientious and emotionally stable during young adulthood and midlife. Openness to new experience increases in the teen years and declines in old age.

If personality can change, even late in life, Roberts told Live Science, the natural next question was whether a person could change his or her personality deliberately . Some research analyzed in the review suggested that even surprisingly short-term interventions might do just that.

In 2009, for example, researchers at Northwestern University in Illinois found that antidepressants make people more extraverted and more emotionally stable . And a 2011 study found that a single dose of psilocybin, the hallucinatory compound in ""magic mushrooms,"" can increase people's openness to experience for at least 14 months , which is considered a long-term change.  When Roberts and his colleagues first became interested in looking at whether interventions can change personality, they expected to find few studies to analyze, because personality psychologists don't typically focus on altering personality , Roberts said.

""I thought we could do this pretty quick, which, you should never say that as an academic,"" Roberts said.

To his surprise, Roberts said, he found what he called a ""gold mine"" of data on personality change. It came from an unexpected source: clinical psychology. While personality psychologists had more or less neglected the question of how to change personality, clinical psychologists had been measuring personality change that resulted from therapy and psychiatric medications all along, but almost as an afterthought.

""Most of the literature is [asking], 'Does this version of cognitive behavioral therapy work better than that version of cognitive behavioral therapy for anxiety ?'"" Roberts said. ""It's usually something very specific to a clinically motivated agenda … [but] in the process, they measure a bunch of different things.""

Those things included personality. The biggest changes, Roberts and his colleagues found, were in people's levels of neuroticism . This trait is marked by jealousy, fear, anxiety and other negative emotions. People typically become less neurotic as they age, Roberts said. The new analysis found that three months of psychological treatment could also significantly lower neuroticism , by about half the amount you might expect to see over 30 to 40 years of adulthood.

""One way to look at that is you get half of a life in a three-month period,"" Roberts said. ""I honestly did not expect to see effect sizes that large.""

Another personality trait, extraversion, also showed significant, though smaller, changes after psychological interventions . The type of therapy used didn't seem to matter, the researchers reported Jan. 5 in the journal Psychological Bulletin, though psychotherapy was associated with slightly larger changes in personality than drug therapies alone. Hospitalization for psychiatric problems did not result in any personality changes, the researchers found. One key question is whether the changes were representative of a change in fundamental personality traits versus simply a shift in psychological state, or mood , Roberts said. A person's mood, for example, can affect how he or she responds to questions about his or her personality.

""If you're in a bad mood and I force you to take a 150-item personality inventory, you might not respond well,"" Roberts said.

Complicating matters, few of the studies available were true experiments that randomly assigned patients to treatment and control groups. Those studies that were experimental, however, did show significantly larger effects on personality in the treatment group compared with the control group, the researchers found. And in the observational studies, follow-ups that took place months or years after treatment showed no evidence that people were backsliding: The changes that followed therapy stayed stable, suggesting that these are changes in people's basic personality traits rather than moment-by-moment moods, the researchers said.

Still, more studies with long follow-up periods need to be done in order to really test the idea that personality can be changed, Roberts said. Ideal research, he said, would include randomly assigning patients to treatment as well as getting outside observers, like friends or family, to rate any personality changes. A perfect study would also follow people for several years after the treatment, Roberts said.

A further question is what is the ""magic ingredient"" in therapy that ushers in personality change, Roberts said.

""If you can actually affect change in something like neuroticism or conscientiousness,"" he said, ""you could possibly have pretty interesting consequences for somebody, because personality traits are important."" "
Fox News,Seattle City Council unanimously supports decriminalizing psychedelic mushrooms,6-Oct-21,https://www.foxnews.com/us/seattle-city-council-unanimously-supports-decriminalizing-psychedelic-mushrooms,"The Seattle City Council on Monday unanimously voted in favor of a resolution supporting the decriminalization of psilocybin and other psychedelics.

The resolution, which is nonbonding and serves only as a recommendation to the Seattle Police Department, declares ""that the investigation, arrest, and prosecution of anyone engaging in entheogen-related activities should be among The City of Seattle’s lowest law enforcement priorities."" The council supports ""full decriminalization of these activities.""

Psilocybin, or ""shrooms,"" is a hallucinogenic drug that falls under the most restrictive Schedule I, which the U.S. federal government defines as ""drugs, substances, or chemicals are defined as drugs with no currently accepted medical use and a high potential for abuse.""

The city council noted that such substances are often used for spiritual purposes, according to their virtual meeting.

""These nonaddictive natural substances have real potential in clinical and therapeutic settings to make a really significant difference in people's lives,"" said council member Andrew Lewis. ""This resolution really sets the stage as the first significant action in the state of Washington to move this policy forward.""

""There's a huge demonstrated potential for these substances to provide cutting-edge treatments for substance abuse, recovery from brain injuries and other issues,"" Lewis told Bloomberg. ""I want to make sure we're following the science in our policies around regulating these substances."" 

Lewis' office noted that drugs such as psilocybin have shown promise for patients who suffer from depression and other mental health problems.

Councilmember Kshama Sawant was not pleased the city council did not make the resolution a binding ordinance. ""I am a little confused by this resolution,"" Sawant said, according to local outlet MyNorthwest. ""We have not pushed for resolutions in place of ordinances where it is possible, realistic, and necessary from a political and moral standpoint for the council to have an ordinance passed.

""I fail to see what the plausible reasons are for councilmembers who claim to support this issue to let an ordinance which takes concrete action sit in the city’s computers unintroduced, and instead push a resolution which only has the power to make requests,"" she added.

Other cities have decriminalized psilocybin, such as Washington, D.C., Denver, and Ann Arbor. Oregon legalized the drug for therapeutic use statewide in 2020."
Fox News,FDA approves ketamine-like nasal spray for depression,6-Mar-19,https://www.foxnews.com/health/fda-approves-ketamine-like-nasal-spray-for-depression,"A mind-altering medication related to the club drug Special K won U.S. approval Tuesday for patients with hard-to-treat depression, the first in a series of long-overlooked substances being reconsidered for severe forms of mental illness.

The nasal spray from Johnson & Johnson is a chemical cousin of ketamine, which has been used for decades as a powerful anesthetic to prepare patients for surgery. In the 1990s, the medication was adopted as a party drug by the underground rave culture due to its ability to produce psychedelic, out-of-body experiences. More recently, some doctors have given ketamine to people with depression without formal FDA approval. The Food and Drug Administration approved Spravato as a fast-acting treatment for patients who have failed to find relief with at least two antidepressants. Up to 7.4 million American adults suffer from so-called treatment-resistant depression, which heightens the risk of suicide, hospitalization and other serious harm, according to the FDA.

The drug will cost between $590 and $885 depending on the dosage and before various insurance discounts and rebates.

There have been no major pharmaceutical innovations for depression since the launch of Prozac and related antidepressants in the late 1980s. Those drugs target the feel-good brain chemical serotonin, and can take weeks or months to kick in.

Ketamine and J&J's version work differently than those drugs, targeting a chemical called glutamate that is thought to restore brain connections that help relieve depression.

When the drug works, its effect is almost immediate. That speed ""is a huge thing because depressed patients are very disabled and suffer enormously,"" said Dr. John Mann, a psychiatrist and researcher at Columbia University. If the drug doesn't work, physicians can quickly switch to other options, he noted.

The FDA approved Spravato, known chemically as esketamine, based on study results that showed patients taking the drug experienced a bigger improvement in their depression levels than patients taking a sham treatment, when measured with a psychiatric questionnaire.

The drug is designed to be lower-dose and easier to use than ketamine, which is normally given as an intravenous infusion. Robin Prothro, 60, began taking antidepressants more than 20 years ago. But she says none of the five medications she tried relieved the depression that has stymied her personal and professional life.

Since enrolling in a Spravato trial two years ago, Prothro says her depression has lifted and she's returned to hobbies she abandoned years ago, like gardening.

She takes the drug every two weeks at her psychiatrist's office while reclining in a comfortable chair.

""You can feel it coming on, it's a strong drug,"" she said, describing colors and shapes that drift before her eyes. ""I just let the drug work. I close my eyes and my mind is amazingly quiet.""

PSYCHEDELICS RECONSIDERED

The ketamine-like drug is the first of several psychoactive substances making their way through the U.S. regulatory process as physicians search further afield for new therapies. Researchers are conducting late-stage trials of psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, and MDMA, a euphoria-inducing club drug, as potential treatments for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.

""Substantially different agents are only rarely appearing from pharmaceutical companies or other laboratories,"" said Dr. Paul Summergrad, a psychiatrist at Tufts University. ""That's prompting people to investigate other compounds.""

Unlike ketamine, psilocybin and MDMA have no legal medical use. Classified in the same category as heroin and LSD, they are tightly restricted by the federal government. But the FDA's approval of esketamine could smooth their path.

BURDEN OF DEPRESSION

Depression is among the leading causes of disability in the U.S. and is being closely monitored by health authorities amid rising suicides nationwide. In 2017, the U.S. suicide rate rose to 14 deaths per 100,000 people, the highest rate in at least 50 years, according to federal records.

Government officials haven't suggested an explanation for the trend, though academic researchers point to the nation's widening income gap, financial struggles and divisive politics.

J&J's drug will be subject to a number of restrictions due to its abuse potential, side effects and lingering safety questions.

The drug will only be given by accredited specialists who must monitor patients for at least two hours after administration, due to its trippy, disorienting effects. Additionally, all patients will be tracked in a registry to monitor long-term safety and effectiveness.

The immediate impact of ketamine is thought to last just four to seven days and there's no consensus yet on how long patients can benefit from ongoing treatment.

Still, there are few other options for patients who fail to respond to antidepressants. The most effective treatment in such cases, electroshock therapy, requires patients to be fully sedated and can cause persistent memory loss.

Wall Street has high expectations for J&J's medication, with analysts predicting more than $600 million in annual sales by 2022. But J&J will face competition in the marketplace.

A decades-old drug, ketamine is already used off-label to treat depression by some doctors. At least 150 clinics around the U.S. provide treatment with various forms of the drug, which is available as a low-cost generic. Patients often pay hundreds or thousands of dollars for intravenous infusions of the drug over several weeks or months. Such therapies are generally not covered by insurance because they haven't been approved as safe and effective by FDA regulators.

Some doctors plan to offer both ketamine and the new J&J drug. Dr. Steve Levine says having FDA-approved standards for dosing and administering the new drug should raise standards in the field and drive out some of the bad actors who are not qualified to treat depression.

""This is going to bring in some standards, regulation and it's going to make it safer and more accessible to patients,"" said Levine, who serves as vice president of the American Society of Ketamine Physicians, a group representing doctors, nurses and others using ketamine for treating depression or other nonapproved uses."
Fox News,DC activists push ballot initiative to decriminalize 'magic' mushrooms,13-Jul-20,https://www.foxnews.com/politics/dc-activists-push-ballot-initiative-to-decriminalize-magic-mushrooms,"Activists in Washington, D.C. have collected more than 36,000 signatures in an effort to force a ballot initiative in November that would decriminalize “magic” mushrooms.

Last week, activists submitted the signatures to the Board of Elections, which will hold a verification process. If the signatures hold up, in the upcoming election voters in Washington, D.C. will have their say on the decriminalization of psilocybin “magic” mushrooms and other natural psychedelics like mescaline, but not peyote or human-made psychedelics like LSD. The proposed ballot would also instruct the Metropolitan Police Department to consider such substances as a low priority.

If passed, the initiative would be the first for an East Coast city, following in the footsteps of Denver, Colo., which was the first city in the nation to pass such an initiative, along with Oakland, Calif., and Santa Cruz, Calif.

The initiative, if passed, would also likely face efforts in Congress to overturn or block its implementation.

Activists have de-emphasized the recreational aspects of the drugs, focusing on the therapeutic and medical benefits as treatment for depression, trauma and addiction.

“D.C. could really lead the way on this,” said campaign manager Melissa Lavasani. “You shouldn’t bear the repercussions of the drug war while you are healing yourself.” The activists had planned to launch their campaign in March with traditional door-to-door canvassing but, due to the coronavirus pandemic, they instead appealed to the D.C. Council for help, which, as part of a larger coronavirus relief package, approved a set of changes allowing residents to download a copy of the petition, sign it, and submit a picture of the signed paper.

Organizers also mailed copies of petitions and detailed packages to nearly 220,000 households."
Fox News,Oregon becomes first state to decriminalize hard drugs like heroin and cocaine,4-Nov-20,https://www.foxnews.com/us/oregon-first-state-decriminalize-hard-drugs-heroin-cocaine,"Oregon became the first state to decriminalize hard drugs like heroin, cocaine and meth in a 59-41% vote as of early Wednesday morning, according to the Associated Press. 

The ""Drug Addiction Treatment and Recovery Act"" will transition Oregon's drug policy from a punitive, criminal approach to ""a humane, cost-effective, health approach.""

""People suffering from addiction are more effectively treated with health care services than with criminal punishments,"" the bill reads. ""A health care approach includes a health assessment to figure out the needs of people who are suffering from addiction, and it includes connecting them to the services they need."" Instead of treating drug users as criminals, Oregon will now offer them addiction services funded by marijuana tax revenue, which is more than $100 million a year in the state. 

Only small amounts of drugs are decriminalized, such as less than 1 gram of heroin or MDMA; 2 grams of cocaine or methamphetamine; 12 grams of psilocybin mushrooms; and 40 doses of LSD, oxycodone or methadone.

Criminal penalties for possession of these amounts are replaced with a fine of up to $100, which can be waived if the user is evaluated at Addiction Recovery Centers.  Crimes that are associated with drug use, such as manufacturing drugs, selling drugs and driving under the influence, are still criminal offenses. 

More than 100 organizations endorsed the measure, including the Oregon Chapter of the American College of Physicians, Oregon Nurses Association, Oregon School Psychologists' Association, Oregon Academy of Family Physicians, the ACLU and others. There was also a fair amount of opposition to the measure, with two dozen district attorneys in the state saying the measure “recklessly decriminalizes possession of the most dangerous types of drugs (and) will lead to an increase in acceptability of dangerous drugs.” Multiple countries in Europe, including Portugal, the Netherlands, and Switzerland, have decriminalized hard drugs without rampant negative effects.  Portugal decriminalized all drugs in 2001, which did not lead to an increase in drug use, but did result in a dramatic reduction of pathologies associated with drug use, such as sexually transmitted diseases and overdose deaths, according to a 2009 Cato Institue study. 

A 2015 European Drug Report also found that Portugal's drug overdose death rate is five times lower than the European Union average. "
