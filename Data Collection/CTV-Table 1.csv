CTV,"New Calgary psychedelic-assisted therapy clinic part of expanding industry, research",17-Mar-22,https://calgary.ctvnews.ca/new-calgary-psychedelic-assisted-therapy-clinic-part-of-expanding-industry-research-1.5824293,"A new clinic in southwest Calgary is treating chronic pain and mental health struggles with ketamine injections among other holistic treatments and therapies.

The founders of SABI Mind in the Sunalta neighbourhood say ketamine therapy is just the start.

""We've already seen the trajectory and journey of cannabis go through a similar situation, and the psychedelic movement is on the precipice of becoming something larger, for mental health and chronic pain,"" said Heesoo Cho, founder and managing director of SABI mind.

Cho created the concept for the clinic after a traumatic event sparked his own journey for mental wellness and exploring psychedelic therapy.

""For me it was quite transformative, the impact was immediate, it expedited a lot of the work for me.""

With a background in the hospitality industry, Cho hopes that many of the clients will also be from the sector that encounters mental health challenges yet often lacks supports.

The five treatment rooms have been designed to create a calming atmosphere and space for ketamine to be administered via needle, monitored by staff including doctors, psychologists and registered nurses.

Clients must get a physician's referral, and a treatment package catered to either chronic pain or mental health begins at $1,500 for nine sessions.

SOME SESSIONS COVERED BY PUBLIC HEALTH
Insurance coverage varies but some sessions are covered by public health says Cho.

""By no means is this a panacea, it's not a miracle drug, there is a process associated with it and what I think what we are trying to do here is tap into a potential to provide additional solutions to an existing system,"" Cho said.

Natalie Alexander is curious about trying the treatment as an event planner who has witnessed mental health struggles among colleagues.

""It's innovation. It's nothing different than technology innovating or systems, its just mental health care, and I think it is something that is now taking the front stage,"" Alexander said.

BURGEONING RESEARCH AREA, INDUSTRY
Psychedelic-assisted therapy is being researched while new clinics continue to open across Canada.

""Psychedelics are controlled under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act (CDSA), which means that activities such as sale, possession and production are illegal unless authorized by Health Canada. As they meet the definition of a drug, they are also regulated under the Food and Drugs Act,"" said Charlaine Sleiman, Health Canada spokesperson, in a statement.

Specific uses of ketamine are approved and regulated by Health Canada, including as a general anaesthetic, however injections of ketamine are considered off-label and are not authorized by Health Canada.

According to Alberta Health, ""physicians are able to use approved drugs off-label; it is a clinical decision. The use of ketamine is tracked by the Alberta Tracked Prescription Program (TPP) administered by the College of Physician and Surgeons of Alberta (CPSA)""

Sleiman says Health Canada is aware of intravenous ketamine being used off-label across many clinics in Canada.

Local researchers say when used carefully, psychedelics such as ketamine offer excitement in the field that hasn't seen much innovation in about 40 years.

""It turns out that things like ketamine do really amazing things, in re-engaging, brain circuits, to kind of come online again, to strengthen the connections between brain cells,"" Jaideep Bains, director of research at the Hotchkiss Brain Institute at the University of Calgary.

Bains said he's interested in the biological affect of psychedelics on the brain, and says more clinical trails and scientific research is needed.

""What we'd really like to figure out is how to change molecules to maintain their therapeutic effect, but eliminate some of the side effects that may not be beneficial.""

Bains says he is interested in research that tries to determine if specific disease-states or brain states can be modified with psychedelic compounds.

Vancouver-based researchers hope psychedelic-assisted therapieswill soon expand in the coming months to include psilocybin (street name: magic mushrooms) or methylenedioxymethamphetamine (a.k.a MDMA or the street name: Molly).

""(With) psychedelic treatments, the promise or optimistic hope for them is they would actually provide short-term very intense treatments where people don't need long term medications,"" Mark Haden, adjunct professor at the University of British Columbia School of Population and Public Health.

POTENTIAL TO TRANSFORM
Haden says psychedelics have the potential to transform medicine, psychiatry and addiction treatment in Canada.

""These professions have often been historically sort of managing symptoms, not curing the problem. Psychedelics offer the opportunity to actually be curative.""

Haden then added, ""When you move away from a prohibitionist model that is expensive and ineffective, and move toward a health model, it saves lives and it saves money.""

On Jan. 5, 2022 Health Canada launched a Special Access Program (SAP) for physicians to access restricted drugs for their patients on a case-by-case basis -- patients cannot apply and access isn't guaranteed.

There are no therapeutic products containing psilocybin, LSD, MDMA or DMT approved for sale in Canada outside of a clinical trial, and Health Canada offered no timeline for when more psychedelics will be authorized for therapeutic use."
CTV,Canadian health-care professionals request psilocybin for training,1-Mar-22,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/canadian-health-care-professionals-request-psilocybin-for-training-1.5801538,"About 80 health-care professionals from across the country are challenging Health Canada's decision to reject their applications to use restricted psychedelic drugs as part of training in psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy.

The professionals — including doctors, psychologists, clinical counsellors, social workers and nurses — sent affidavits to Health Canada on Monday after the federal agency issued a letter of intent to reject their requests.

They sought exemptions last year to use controlled substances in their practices under a section of the Canadian Drugs and Substances Act that allows for exceptions. ""For the last two years, we haven't been able to train enough health-care practitioners to keep up with the demand of patients in need of psychedelic-assisted therapy,"" said Spencer Hawkswell, CEO of TheraPsil, an advocacy group that operates the training program the health-care practitioners are enrolled in.

""We need emergency access. After a year of waiting, they're being told no, and that's unacceptable, because so many of them have patients, some of (whom) have died … waiting for support. They could have been helped.""

Psychedelic-assisted therapy involves ingesting consciousness-altering substances — including psilocybin, ketamine, LSD or MDMA (the active ingredient in ecstasy) — in a clinical setting as part of more traditional psychotherapy.

Hawkswell said hundreds of Canadians inquire about it every year because they are in palliative care, have become treatment resistant or are struggling with end-of-life distress. Others ask for the substances to treat their anxiety, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder or other illnesses.

""There are only three practitioners on TheraPsil’s roster ... that are authorized to act as primary therapists and have undergone experiential training,"" says the affidavit filed by TheraPsil's lawyer Nicholas Pope.

""Trained practitioners are clustered in only a few areas of Canada making them practically inaccessible to patients outside the local vicinity.""

In the document, Dr. Valorie Masuda of Victoria, B.C., who has received experimental training through a clinical trial, says ""she has no additional capacity to take on any more patients, and she does not know of anyone else to whom she could refer a patient for assessment, support and treatment.""

Hawkswell said many Canadians are going underground to receive the therapy ""and that's going to continue if we don't train therapists.""

Hawkswell and Yassie Pirani, a Vancouver-based registered clinical counsellor, say it is necessary for experts who support patients during their psychotherapy to experience the therapy itself.

""The experiential component is absolutely essential,"" said Pirani, who is also one of the dozens noted in the affidavits submitted to Health Canada.

""It's believed that by experiencing this non-ordinary state of consciousness first-hand, therapists ... are going to be better able to intervene and, more importantly, know when not to intervene, and help patients integrate their psilocybin experience.""

Pirani, who helps treat anxiety and depression, said the efficacy of psilocybin is ""really exciting.""

There are medications doctors currently prescribe, for example, that can lead to irreversible sexual dysfunction, but ""psilocybin has a lot less risk and this is known in the research.""

Health Canada recently amended its laws to allow physicians to request restricted psychedelic drugs for patients as part of their psychotherapy.

TheraPsil's lawyer, Pope, said the requests take time and require ""many hours from multiple health-care practitioners who are knowledgeable and properly trained to assess, support, and treat a patient."" But there are not enough to meet the demand.

Health Canada suggests in its letter that professionals requesting exemptions for training should enrol in a clinical trial already approved in which they could access psilocybin, or Therapsil can create its own clinical trial.

Health-care practitioners already knew about the clinical trial before their request for exemption, Hawkswell said.

""They have said that this clinical trial will not work either because of cost, because of location, because of the timing. Clinical trials cost potentially millions of dollars.

""We've got dying patients right now.""

Health Canada says it has granted about 80 exemptions for patients suffering from end-of-life psychological distress, treatment-resistant depression and major depressive disorder. Hawkswell added that some have cancer, PTSD and chronic pain.

In 2020, TheraPsil represented 17 health-care practitioners who successfully challenged Health Canada's intent to reject their application.

Hawkswell and lawyer Pope said they are ready to make a charter application if Health Canada does not retract its rejection.

""You can't have patients' life, liberty and security infringed upon, and there's little to no evidence the exemption would cause harm to public safety,"" Pope said."
CTV,Update on psychedelic therapy drugs a positive step in mental-health care: experts,15-Jan-22,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/update-on-psychedelic-therapy-drugs-a-positive-step-in-mental-health-care-experts-1.5741493,"A doctor and a psychologist say Health Canada's move to allow physicians to request restricted psychedelic drugs for patients as part of their psychotherapy is a positive step toward transforming mental-health care.

But they say the recent change to the Special Access Program isn't enough.

""We still have a huge amount of work to do because these medicines could really, really revolutionize the entire mental health-care field,"" said Dr. Michael Verbora, who works as a medical director at the Field Trip Health therapy centre in Toronto. ""I don't want to get too far ahead of where the science is ... but I do really, really believe that if people have a process to start their own healing, it can lead to a much better world for most people.""

Psychedelic assisted therapy involves ingesting consciousness-altering substances -- including psilocybin, ketamine, LSD or MDMA (the active ingredient in ecstasy) -- in a clinical setting as part of more traditional psychotherapy.

Health Canada has said requests will be considered on a case-by-case basis for a ""serious or life-threatening condition"" and where other conventional treatments have failed, are unsuitable for the patient or are not available in Canada.

Verbora said the change isn't designed to have a wait list, because it's meant for emergencies. Health Canada has said applications will be processed within two days, but it's unclear when a decision would be made.

What it has done is streamline potential access to restricted drugs, Verbora said.

""Unfortunately, if you have a terminal illness, you don't have much life left in you. You don't have time to apply to the government and wait months to get an exemption.""

Edmonton-based psychologist Brian Welling calls the approach ""revolutionary.""

""This is the greatest leap forward in mental-health care since the invention of psychotherapy,"" he said.

""I've used psychedelics many, many times. I didn't have a serious or life-threatening condition, but for my own personal problems and part of my own spiritual journey, these experiences have been life-changing.

Verbora, who filed his first application on behalf of a patient this week, said one of the biggest challenges is that more physicians need education on psychedelic therapy.

""The responsibility really falls on the physician to do all the paperwork, which is like to write 100 prescriptions in the time that I do one of these applications,' he said. ""Then I'll have to access the drug. I'll have to store the drug. I'll have to educate the patient on the drug.""

Ronan Levy, co-founder ofField Trip Health,said most applications except the most severe will probably be rejected.

He said he hopes Health Canada's criteria for approval of psychedelics expand in the future.

The government has said the regulatory amendment does not signal ""an intent towards the decriminalization or legalization of restricted drugs.""

However, that conversation needs to start, said Verbora.

""We have a long way to go to help the millions of people around the world that unfortunately suffer from mental-health issues and (their) growing burden.""

All three men suggest that can happen by removing the stigma around psychedelics.

""When done in the right circumstances, with the proper oversight, with trained clinicians who can support the experience, the outcomes can be fantastic,"" Levy said.

""That leads to people who have greater emotional resilience, people who are more able to adapt to circumstances like a global pandemic."""
CTV,Providing a light': Anorexia patient and psychiatrist-in-training hopes to transform mental health care,11-Dec-21,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/providing-a-light-anorexia-patient-and-psychiatrist-in-training-hopes-to-transform-mental-health-care-1.5704035,"The first time Nikhita Singhal stopped eating, she was just seven years old. By the age of eight, she had to be hospitalized.

She spent five weeks in the hospital, where therapy included forced feedings. They were “very, very traumatic experiences” that had a profoundly negative and lasting impact, she says.

After she was discharged, her care continued on an outpatient basis. Over many years, she saw numerous doctors, tried many different types of psychotherapy, counselling, medications, and treatment settings, but remained depressed, anxious, and sometimes even suicidal, and had another major hospital stay when she was 17. What worked for others was not working for her.

Eating disorders can be difficult to treat and are not as well-studied compared to other mental illnesses, yet affect as many as a million Canadians, according to the National Initiative for Eating Disorders (NIED) and Statistics Canada.

Because of the physical manifestation of the disorder, some estimates suggest 10 to 15 per cent die due to medical complications like heart disease -- the highest overall mortality rate of any mental illness, according to one study cited by NIED. The suicide rate among those with eating disorders is also high. And even more concerning is the increasing number of younger people at risk of developing an eating disorder, experts say.

A new study published in the JAMA Open Network found that cases and hospitalizations for newly-diagnosed anorexia nervosa or atypical anorexia nervosa among children and adolescents in Canada increased during the first wave of the pandemic.

Singhal wants to change those facts. Now 26, she is training to become a psychiatrist, hoping to specialize in child and adolescent mental health, studying at the University of Toronto and doing her residency at Toronto General Hospital, with the goal of transforming how eating disorders are treated. She hopes her experience on both sides can help bridge the enormous gap often found between patients and doctors.

“Ever since my first experiences with the mental-health system, I saw that there were a lot of things about it that were broken,” Singhal told CTV News in an interview.

“It's not that patients are failing treatment. Treatment is failing patients and we need to do better ... what I saw was that maybe the best way to do that would be to become part of the system and try to change it from the inside.”

Singhal eventually found a treatment that worked for her. But what is important, she says, is recognizing that each patient is different: having a thoughtful, individualized approach and a willingness to explore novel avenues of therapy is key.

As a confused eight year old, unclear about what was happening and surrounded by teenagers in the treatment program, being hospitalized was frightening.

“It was a pretty traumatic experience being in there,” she said.

“Everything from having nasal gastric tubes forced down your throat to [seeing] how much the other patients were struggling, and being totally taken out of your environment.”

Some of the trauma came from a lack of control, particularly when part of the treatment involved taking away that control and putting it into the hands of those trying to help you, she said.

Singhal couldn’t explain at the time why she did not want to eat. “It was just a sense of, I just didn’t want to eat.”

But she had lost a grandfather and was having issues at school with her peers -- possible factors that triggered symptoms of anxiety and repetitive behaviours later recognized as obsessive compulsive disorder.

EATING DISORDERS AND YOUNG CANADIANS
According to NIED, the physical and mental health impact of eating disorders are as debilitating as psychosis and schizophrenia. About 20 per cent of those with anorexia and 25 to 35 per cent of those with bulimia may attempt suicide in their lifetime, the organization says. And for females between the ages of 15 and 24, the death rate related to anorexia is 12 times greater than all other causes of death combined, according to one study.

“In general, we're good at treating eating disorders but not great,” said Dr. Wendy Spettigue, a child and adolescent psychiatrist who has specialized in the assessment and treatment of severe eating disorders at the Children's Hospital in Ottawa for more than 20 years.

The success rate for a full recovery through family-based therapy for child and adolescents is about 50 to 60 per cent, she estimated.

“It's still many, many young people and people out there struggling with eating disorders. And so we need to get better at it…it takes incredible strength and courage and determination to recover from an eating disorder,” said Spettigue, who is also an associate professor of psychiatry at the University of Ottawa.

“We often compare it to climbing a very high mountain because you have to be able to resist the urges of the voices or thoughts in your head, telling you not to eat or not to keep it down. It's very difficult not to listen to those thoughts.”

A part of Singhal also felt very attached to the illness. “It felt safe and familiar and it felt like people were trying to take that away from me,” she said.

One of her last hospital trips was when she was 17, where she stayed for over a month before transitioning into a day program for another half year.

“There were so many of us who went through it and it was like a revolving door,” Singhal said, but the underlying issues remained unaddressed. She says there is a lot of focus on the food when in reality, it is a complex illness with many underlying issues.

“I think there was just a sense of hopelessness and not seeing that it could ever get better, having gone through so many of the different treatments that are out there. And it’s really been years. And also hearing that the longer people have this disorder, the less chance there is that they will get better.”

Her experience is what has spurred her to go into psychiatry -- she does not want others to go through what she went through. Spettigue says that kind of experience can be invaluable as a practitioner.

“We know statistically that there are millions of young people out there and millions of people suffering from an eating disorder. And to see a kind, caring, compassionate, loving person say, ‘Yes, I understand. I had an eating disorder’ -- I think is very, very helpful,” she said, adding that patient-oriented research is also an important new movement that recognizes the value of hearing from patients and their families on what their journey was like.

“It's very brave when somebody comes out publicly to say that yes, I suffered from this illness, I had an eating disorder, and I want to help others and help others to understand.”

INNOVATIVE TREATMENTS
One treatment that has given Singhal hope is psychedelics, which she has used with therapy. It has helped keep her condition under control and given her more energy and stamina to study.

“Having experienced that, it was revolutionary. Never before had I been able to look in the mirror and not hate what I saw, both just physically and also [what] kind of a person that I am,” Nikhita Singhal said. But now, she can look at herself with self-compassion.

“There were times I didn't want to be here anymore. And it's -- yeah, it was not good. But since then, things have gotten a lot better.”

Singhal was introduced to this therapy through her father, Canadian tech entrepreneur and venture capitalist Sanjay Singhal. He had grappled with mental health issues for decades himself, but everything changed after he underwent several transformative psilocybin sessions. He hopes they can eventually do the same for his daughter.

While the research in psychedelic medicine is still considered to be in the early stages -- even more so with respect to eating disorders like anorexia -- Sanjay Singhal was inspired to help fund Canada’s first psychedelic psychotherapy research centre for mental health at Toronto’s University Health Network because of his family’s experiences.

For others who have struggled their entire lives with an eating disorder, Nikhita Singhal says not to give up, that hope and change are coming.

“There is a future and don't let your light go out. And one day you'll be able to help other people and provide a light on their journey too.”"
CTV,Canadian entrepreneur gifts $5 million to help create psychedelic research centre for mental health,24-Oct-21,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/canadian-entrepreneur-gifts-5-million-to-help-create-psychedelic-research-centre-for-mental-health-1.5636578,"TORONTO -- Canadian tech entrepreneur and venture capitalist Sanjay Singhal was in his early 30s when he was first diagnosed with bipolar disorder. It had been a lifelong struggle -- one moment feeling great, then suddenly mentally paralyzed and unable to get out of bed for three straight days.

“When I went manic, I would make bad decisions ... spend money unreasonably,” he said. “Up until age 38, my life was a roller coaster.”

Today, Singhal is 56 and on a mission to transform mental health care. He is the philanthropist behind Canada’s first psychedelic psychotherapy research centre for mental health at Toronto’s University Health Network (UHN). Starting with a $5 million donation made through the Nikean Foundation that he founded, Singhal hopes researchers at the centre can unlock the potential of psychedelic medicine and find answers on how psilocybin and a so-called “God molecule” can help transform mental health care. The founder of several start-ups, including Audiobooks.com, Singhal spoke to CTV National News about his struggles with mental health even as he built several successful businesses.

“I was very aware of what mental illness can do,” he said in his very first on-air interview about the subject and his personal struggles with it.

But it is not just about him. He also has a daughter, Nikki, who has struggled with anorexia since childhood that he also wants to help. She was hospitalized at the age of eight, and again when she was 16. Now a third year resident in psychiatry at the University of Toronto, she has done well but continues to navigate through her struggles.

A chance presentation several years ago by Robin Carhart-Harris, one of the world’s leading researchers on psychedelic medicine that mentioned psilocybin as a potential treatment for anorexia piqued Singhal’s interest. Carhart-Harris is the head of the Centre for Psychedelic Research, a division of Brain Sciences with the Faculty of Medicine at the Imperial College London.

“I thought, oh my God, I have to go listen to this guy and see what's going on...I spoke to him afterwards, drove him to the airport, and then a couple of weeks later, my daughter and I both flew to London … we were amazed at the possibilities of what this could do.”

But Singhal is quick to note that at the Canadian research centre, psychedelic medicine will only be used alongside therapy in a controlled setting.

“I don't want people to do this on their own,” he said. “I don't want this to become recreational play.”

A POTENTIAL PARADIGM SHIFT
The potential of psychedelic therapy goes as far back as the 1950s when several pioneering psychiatrists experimented with LSD as a possible treatment for mental health disorders. Some of the earliest groundbreaking experiments and research happened in Saskatchewan. But studies into these drugs ended by the 1960s amid social and political backlash.

For scientists, the new research centre represents potential for transformational change in mental health therapies and offers new hope for many patients.

“I was thrilled beyond belief because psychiatry hasn't had a real paradigm shift or a new opportunity at treatment in a long time,” said Dr. Susan Abbey, psychiatrist-in-Chief for the Centre for Mental Health at UHN, in an interview.

“There truly is a signal that there is something to this. And, really, every major academic center in mental health in the world is trying to begin to conduct research in psychedelic, particularly psychedelic assisted psychotherapy.”

There are many disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder and end-of-life distress, that are treatment resistant, says Abbey.

Dr. Emma Hapke, a staff psychiatrist with UHN and lecturer at the University of Toronto agrees.

“We haven’t had a lot of new treatments in psychiatry in a long time. There seem to be more people suffering…struggling and there is an appetite for something new that might work,” Hapke told CTV National News in a phone interview.

Traditional medications prescribed for mental health care typically suppress symptoms, Hapke said. While much more research is needed, there are suggestions that psychedelics work differently and do not require ongoing use.

The centre is planning six to eight research projects, including psilocybin therapy for end-of-life grief, grief suffered by caregivers, families who have lost a child, and body dysmorphic disorder.

It also hopes to research a separate psychedelic called 5-MeO-DMT, also called “The God Molecule'' due to the profound psychoactive effects on the user, as a potential therapy for PTSD. Found in a wide variety of plants, it is also secreted by the glands of the Sonoran Desert Toad. It is illegal in the United States but unregulated in Canada. BuzzFeed News once described it as “the most powerful psychedelic on the planet.”

The centre is also looking at training programs for licensed therapists to learn how to work with psychedelics, since treatments will likely also involve therapy for patients to understand the insights that emerge with treatment.

TRYING PSILOCYBIN AND THE ‘GOD MOLECULE’
Singhal grew up in a tumultuous household, and from a young age, built emotional walls around himself without even realizing. If he encountered someone who clearly needed emotional comfort, his automatic response was escape.

“I was afraid of other people’s emotions,” Singhal said. After three psilocybin sessions, everything changed.

“Now, my instant thought is, I need to sit down with this person and comfort them, find out what's going on. That has been tremendously beneficial for my relationships.”

Singhal’s original intent when he decided to try psilocybin as a therapy was to find out why he sometimes drank too much and to get a handle on that aspect of his life. He had already been seeing a therapist for 20 years, and while it has helped him get through some of the most depressed periods of his life, psilocybin was different. Suddenly, he felt liberated, he said.

“The psilocybin took me on this circuitous journey of, no, let's explore what's really going on here,” he said.

But Singhal is perhaps even more interested in the potential of 5-MeO-DMT, which is still in the drug development process phase and likely years away from clinical trial use.

One of the challenges with psilocybin and MDMA is that they are expensive treatments, Singhal explained. It takes four to six hours in a room with one or two trained therapists, licensed professionals, so a single treatment can run upwards of $2,000 or more.

5-MeO-DMT lasts just 15 minutes, which makes potential treatment significantly more affordable, he said.

”You're not aware you're conscious, but you're not aware of what's going on so when you come back from that trip, all you know is something beautiful happens. And all of a sudden you feel better,” Singhal said.

While much of the new research involving these psychedelics are still considered very early stage, Singhal’s experience and newfound peace gives him hope.

“The apparent lack of adverse effects is reassuring and consistent with what we know about these compounds more generally – that when administered in a responsible manner, to suitable and prepared individuals, they are almost invariably well-tolerated,” according to a research commentary on 5-MeO-DMT published in 2019 in The American Journal of Drug and Alcohol Abuse.

But it also added that “any conclusions pertaining to the antidepressant efficacy of 5-MeO-DMT must wait until the appropriate clinical trials are conducted.”

UHN doctors agree all the compounds need rigorous scientific study.

""We need to take a very careful approach... so that we don't just get so swept away with potential excitement, but that we're really understanding how medications work what they do for people,"" said Abbey.

Singhal acknowledges that much of the evidence that psychedelics could be used to help with anorexia or other mental disorders is anecdotal, but it is enough that he is willing to write a big check to fund the research necessary.

“We're all traumatized children running around in adult bodies, and these medicines can help us all,” Singhal said.

“I would say, now, three years later, my daughter has tried various treatments, and she's still struggling, but she has hope. And if … this gives somebody hope, that's a tremendous gift.”  "
CTV,"Ketamine and psilocybin, better known as party drugs, showing promise for treatment of mood disorders",23-Oct-21,https://www.ctvnews.ca/w5/ketamine-and-psilocybin-better-known-as-party-drugs-showing-promise-for-treatment-of-mood-disorders-1.5634691,"TORONTO -- It’s been more than a decade since Bruno Guevremont returned to Canada from his military deployment to Afghanistan. Like so many other veterans, Guevremont’s combat experiences took a mental toll.

During his second tour in 2009, Guevremont was part of a team that dismantled IEDs, or improvised explosive devices.

One incident, in particular, changed him. Guevremont says he was the first Canadian soldier ever to defuse a suicide vest on a living person. But it wasn’t the high degree of danger in that situation that affected him. “The suicide bomber was mentally challenged. He had been told that if he doesn't do this, then they were going to kill his family,” Guevremont told W5 correspondent Avery Haines. “So that started playing with my mind.”

After his return to Canada, Guevremont suffered panic attacks and suicidal thoughts. He was diagnosed with PTSD, depression and anxiety. When talk therapy and anti-depressants didn’t help, Guevremont sought alternatives in an attempt to recover his mental health. He joined an Arctic expedition with other veterans in 2014, captained Team Canada at the 2016 Invictus Games, and became a mental health spokesperson for Bell Let’s Talk Day.

Then, in March, 2020, the COVID-19 lockdown sent Guevremont into a tailspin, and he contemplated suicide again.

“I started getting really depressed, started getting dark thoughts,” he told W5.

That’s when Guevremont learned about an unconventional treatment for severe depression and PTSD, involving the drug ketamine.

Ketamine is notorious for being a hallucinogenic party drug nicknamed Special K, a veterinary tranquilizer and an anesthetic that’s been used in hospitals for over 50 years. But at sub-anesthetic doses, the drug has shown an ability to quickly reduce symptoms of depression and suicidal thinking, within weeks to hours. “The magnitude of improvement on the symptoms approaches in many studies between 40 to 70 percent improvement within a couple of weeks,” noted Dr. Roger McIntyre, a professor of Psychiatry and Pharmacology at the University of Toronto. In 2018, McIntyre founded the Canadian Rapid Treatment Center of Excellence (CRTCE) - Canada’s first private clinic to offer ketamine treatments for depression.

The Canadian Mental Health Association reports that approximately five per cent of Canadians are affected by major depression and more than 4,000 Canadians died by suicide in 2019.

Ketamine appears to be especially promising for people who have not had success treating their depression with conventional monoamine anti-depressants, which -- when they work -- also generally take four to six weeks to achieve maximal benefit.

“This is truly a breakthrough,” said Dr. McIntyre.

In November 2020, after his bout with depression, Bruno Guevremont travelled from his home in Victoria, B.C. to Field Trip Health, in Toronto - for orally administered ketamine treatment. While ketamine’s anti-depressant effects are well documented, therapists at Field Trip Health also aim to maximize the psychedelic qualities of the drug and combine it with psychotherapy.

“The transformation doesn't happen within the session itself. That happens before and after, when you are working on your trauma, when you're actually making sense of it,” said Guevremont.

In 2020, Health Canada approved a ketamine-derived nasal spray for treatment-resistant depression and has allowed off-label use of the drug when administered intravenously or orally by health care professionals.

But a host of other illegal psychedelics and party drugs are also being studied for their therapeutic value. Among them, psilocybin, the psychoactive ingredient in magic mushrooms. Clinical trials with psilocybin have shown an improvement in symptoms for patients battling a range of disorders including depression and anxiety.

Though scheduled as a controlled substance, in 2020 Health Canada started offering what are known as Section 56 exemptions to patients with end-of-life distress so they could undergo therapeutic sessions with the drug.

Meanwhile, clinics that treat depression with ketamine are opening up across Canada. There are currently at least 12 private facilities and several hospital-based programs.

But ketamine treatments are not a “cure” or even suitable for everyone with mood disorders. Patients may be ineligible for treatment if they exhibit a history of psychosis, hypertension or substance abuse.

A typical ketamine treatment regimen involves 4 to 6 sessions over a two-to three-week period. Patients often need booster doses and the long term effects are still unclear, though researchers say there is little evidence to support addiction to the drug when it’s administered under medical supervision.

Also, the cost of private treatment isn’t cheap -- $750 per ketamine session and $250 for each psychotherapy appointment at Field Trip Health, and approximately $850 per intravenous infusion at the CRTCE.

But for patients like Bruno Guevremont, treatments with ketamine have offered a renewed outlook.

“Life is actually enjoyable, which is amazing,” he said. “I didn't want to be here. Now I do.”"
CTV,Magic mushrooms coming out of the shadows in Vancouver,14-Jun-21,https://bc.ctvnews.ca/magic-mushrooms-coming-out-of-the-shadows-in-vancouver-1.5470518,"VANCOUVER - The pandemic has seen a huge increase in the number of people suffering from a variety of mental health disorders like anxiety and depression. According to a poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation, there are four times as many people suffering now compared to pre-pandemics levels. A Vancouver company is hoping to help change that.
Vancouver Delic Corp. and Delic Labs are currently conducting research into psilocybin, or magic mushrooms, which has shown promise as an alternative therapy for various mental health issues.

Those include “PTSD, depression, treatment-resistant depression, OCD, anxiety,” said Matt Stang, Delic CEO. “Right now Canada has the only licensure that allows for psilocybin research.” 

Delic is also in the final stages of acquiring three ketamine infusions centres in the U.S., two in Phoenix and one in Bakersfield California.

Emily Curtis, who suffers from depression, sought out psychedelic therapy after suffering a severe depressive event in 2017.

“I’ve kind of had problems with clinical depression, on and off, since I was in college,” Curtis explained.

“Nothing was really working.”

Until she started going to a ketamine infusion centre.

“I know a lot of people when I talk about using ketamine infusions they’re like, ‘Oh special K, the party drug?’”

While they may illegal party drugs for some, Ketamine and psilocybin are coming out of the shadows.

“These novel molecules are perhaps the most beneficial way to help people with mental health disorders,” said Stang. “Right now Canada has the only licensure that allows for psilocybin research.”

There are several studies showing promise for psychedelic therapies as well. Although Health Canada has no approved psilocybin products, it told CTV News it has granted 36 exemptions for psilocybin treatments for terminally ill patients suffering psychological distress.

However, there is still a long way to go before and more research to be done before these kind of therapies to be fully approved.

“I don’t want to be the person who comes on and says here’s these magic beans, it’s going to fix everything and the world’s going to be better,” said Stang.

However, he is hopeful, and so is Curtis, who says ketamine has made a huge difference for her.

“You just don’t know who’s suffering,” she said. “I’ve been able to kind of figure out a new career. I have been able to be a present parent. It’s really been a game changer for me.” "
CTV,University of Calgary announces chair in psychedelic research,9-Jun-21,https://calgary.ctvnews.ca/university-of-calgary-announces-chair-in-psychedelic-research-1.5462489,"CALGARY - A first of its kind in Canada research chair is being established in Calgary to oversee exploration into the potential use of psychedelics to improve mental health. 
The Parker Psychedelic Research Chair is being funded by Calgary businessman Jim Parker, who donated $3 million to the Hotchkiss Brain Institute to establish the program.

Parker’s interest in psychedelics came after his 21-year-old niece Courtney was diagnosed with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Trapped in her home and paralyzed by flashbacks, she was afraid to leave the house and was unable to study for school.  She saw a doctor and trauma counsellor, and was prescribed medication to help her overcome the PTSD. She says the treatment did little but left her feeling numb and unable to heal.

 ""I was very concerned about Courtney and, in 2018, I started reading the psychedelics-related research papers out of Johns Hopkins, Imperial College and others,"" said Parker. ""The data was showing that psychedelics were providing benefits to people suffering from anxiety, depression, addiction and PTSD.

""At that time there weren’t any options for this type of treatment in Canada, so we decided together on a clinic in California.""

Parker helped Courtney book into the stateside clinic offering psychedelic therapy and she received five rounds of intravenous ketamine therapy.  The treatments were carefully dosed and conducted under medical supervision.

""They took me into a room with a chair and sleeping mask and headphones with spa music. The ketamine took me out of body – you’re able to see your trauma from a third-party perspective, which was really helpful,"" explained Courtney. ""For the first time, I could see myself from a place of compassion. It was not easy to go through, but it was definitely beneficial.""

Courtney says she has returned to living a full and happy life post-treatment. While she still sees her doctor and therapist, she has stopped taking many of the medications and is set to graduate with honours from business school this year.

After seeing the positive effect the treatments had on his niece, Parker was motivated to bring the treatments to Canada and help people here

""She tried everything she possibly could and it wasn't working,"" said Parker. ""Then this did work, and it really was transformational.   I had read the research but to see firsthand how these treatments helped Courtney was amazing.

""We need research to better understand the safety and efficacy of these treatments in order to gain mainstream acceptance and maximize the benefits.""

In the United States, the medical use of psychedelics has been given 'breakthrough status' by the U.S. Food and Drug Administrations to fast track work into this area of treatment for mental health issues.

""The use of psychedelics is pretty new and there's a strong body of evidence to support its use in some ways, and in some conditions,"" said Dr. Valerie Taylor, professor and head of the department of psychiatry at the University of Calgary's Cumming School of Medicine  

""That being said, it's far from a slam dunk. We need bigger trials, we need well-designed trials, and we need to really investigate who this works for, and who it doesn't.  That's why the Parker Chair in Psychedelics, which is the first of its kind in Canada, is really going to be instrumental in our broadening minds around, not just this new therapy,  but looking at other new therapies as well.""

Parker is also starting a private clinic in Calgary, aiming to provide a place where people can receive legal ketamine assisted therapy, and participate in research trials with other psychedelics. 

""The idea is to start with what we can use legally, which is ketamine. The setting, and the model of therapy would be very similar in the future for psilocybin and MDMA (methylenedioxymethamphetamine),"" said Parker. ""There's a lot of research going on in those areas. So I think we can expect that there's a good chance that we can use those substances or medicines in the near future.""

There is already one clinic in the Calgary area providing psychedelic treatment under licence from Health Canada.

Atma Urban Journey Clinic uses magic mushrooms in its therapy.  Under federal legislation, it is presently only allowed to offer psychedelic treatment to terminally ill patients. David Harder, the clinic's founder, says overcoming the misguided perception of psychedelics —often seen as 'illicit drugs' — is perhaps the biggest advance the U of C research chair might make.

""The stigma is still pretty high. Although what we're seeing in the last year, even in 12 months, I would say the stigma has dropped by half,"" said Harder. ""Psychedelics have just been suppressed for so long. It's frustrating to me that we're doing this so that we can convince Health Canada to make it legal. It should be where we should be doing this so that we can find new and interesting ways of applying these things."""
CTV,Approval for new psilocybin research facility in Norfolk County,27-Apr-21,https://london.ctvnews.ca/approval-for-new-psilocybin-research-facility-in-norfolk-county-1.5403785,"LONDON, ONT. -- New Leaf Canada has received approval from Health Canada that will allow its subsidiary Psirenity to begin construction of a psilocybin research facility in Norfolk County.

The new research centre will be roughly 185 square metres within the larger New Leaf facility. Its approval was announced last week.

There is growing evidence that psilocybin could be used to treat anxiety and depression. “The process of attaining the CDSA (Controlled Drugs and Substances Act), the dealer's licence, which allows us to work with controlled substances such as psilocybin. We began the application almost a year ago,” says Psirenity CEO Chris McCullough.

With the approval the company will focus its research and development into these key areas:

 formulation of investigational products for future clinical trials
 supply of investigational products for Psirenity's clinical trials
 psilocybin and psilocin production
 psilocybin containing mushroom strain development
 supply of prescription-controlled drugs for Psirenity's Health and Wellness Therapy Clinics
 extraction and isolation of psilocybin and psilocin method development
“What we’re working on is a micro-dosing platform. Something that doesn’t have the psychotropic effects where you can take your micro-dose and be able to go about your day. You can go to work, you can drive your car and so forth.”

McCullough says they are working with regulators and Health Canada to work toward new treatments in psychedelic-enhanced mental health treatments.

Currently, Health Canada has not approved any treatments for use, and psilocybin is considered an illegal substance under the law. However, there have been exceptions made on compassionate grounds in some cases.

“As an emerging treatment mechanism, especially for mental health and wellness, I think there has to be safeguards put in place, there has to be a frame work by the governing bodies,” McCullough explains.

The company became the first to be approved by the University of the West Indies ethics community to conduct a phase one clinical trial for safety and efficacy around micro-dosing.

They also established a partnership in Jamaica to run a similar trial that will conclude prior to the start of a physician-led Canadian study tentatively scheduled to begin at the end of 2021 or in early 2022.

“We will have completed by that time our phase one clinical trial in Jamaica, which will also provide the necessary supporting data and results to help bolster the physician-led trial in Canada,” says McCullough.

Construction on the facility in Norfolk County is expected to begin within 60 days."
CTV,"Psychedelic drugs can help treat PTSD caused by racism, discrimination: researchers",26-Jan-21,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/psychedelic-drugs-can-help-treat-ptsd-caused-by-racism-discrimination-researchers-1.5283471,"TORONTO -- Racism, discrimination, physical and verbal abuse, microaggressions -- Kanu Caplash says he has experienced them all. Bullied and tormented growing up in the United States because of his race, Caplash suffered from “racial trauma” -- a form of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) characterized by symptoms like anxiety and depression.

“I've had my head smashed into windows. I got chased around hallways. I got stabbed twice,” said Caplash, a 21-year-old of South Asian descent who lives in Newtown, Conn.

“I get … called various names, you know -- from the N word to terrorists to honestly anything you could think of. There wasn't too many minorities in the area, so they would just kind of use any kind of racial slur they could think of, and just kind of direct that towards me.” Several racialized groups do appear to have higher rates of PTSD that is likely attributed to racial trauma, says Dr. Monnica Williams, Canada Research Chair for Mental Health Disparities at the University of Ottawa and a clinical psychologist.

“This traumatization is a result of experiencing discrimination. And the problem is that we don't have enough people of colour in the mental health workforce to meet the needs,” she said.

She had been studying PTSD for some time, particularly in people of colour. PTSD treatment can be very demanding, requiring patients to revisit their traumas in detail. It is scary for clients and difficult for therapists too, Williams said. When she learned about research being done with psychedelics and its impact when used with psychotherapy, she recognized how it could help people of colour.

“There were individuals who were using alcohol to cope and really having difficulty connecting with people and after the treatment, it was an amazing transformation to see people's faces brighten and see them get their lives back,” said Williams.

Williams is the co-lead author of a recent retrospective study that found those who tried doses of psilocybin (more commonly known as magic mushrooms), LSD, or MDMA (the pure substance found in Ecstasy or Molly) reported a decrease in trauma symptoms, depression and anxiety after 30 days.

FROM HONOUR ROLL TO THOUGHTS OF SUICIDE
On paper, things appeared great for Caplash -- an honour roll student, a gifted athlete, competitive swimmer and public speaker. But growing up as one of the few visible minorities in a predominantly white environment meant being hounded by bullies throughout his school years, according to Caplash. The constant barrage of abuse left him feeling anxious, hopeless, depressed, even suicidal.

“I just hid in this place weeping for hours, you know? Just contemplating that I want to end it all,” Caplash said.

He recalled avoiding sleep so he wouldn’t have nightmares -- once going 84 hours without it. He reached some of his lowest points in seventh grade, he said, coming “very, very close” to attempting suicide.

“We don't have any options or resources because the school system isn't doing much to help,” Caplash said, adding that if anything, the system makes it worse.

‘They bring the bullies and they reprimand them and then all that does is teach them how to be sneakier, and more horrible and effective in their own way.”

He was always tense, constantly stressed. It made him irritable, angry, and depressed. He didn’t think he would survive past the age of 40.

“It gets impossible to kind of motivate myself to even get out of bed because it's like, why? Why do I want to go and keep living when I'm just going to get more traumatized?” Caplash said.

“You kind of realize you don't have any other choice but to just survive, and surviving is kind of just enough. I was anxious and I was scared, but after a while you kind of get used to it to an extent. Just focus on surviving.”

Then, in college, a friend told Caplash about a study using MDMA to treat PTSD. He had reservations going into the study, but decide to participate to help himself and help scientists get answers for racialized patients.

A LIFE FOUND IN PIANO KEYS
In his first session with a psychoactive drug, Caplash recalled a vision in which he was standing on translucent piano keys in the middle of a universe. As he ran across each one, he could see a different part of his life within each key.

“When you can visually see yourself living past 40 ... when I can see yourself happy, it just destroys all emotion of you thinking you're not going to live past 40,” he said.

He also dove into the piano keys that held his traumas and experienced what felt like living out the trauma for a thousand years, he described.

“It becomes a lot easier to process it because you're processing it over and over and over and over again and that's effectively what therapy is … processing your traumas to the point where ... they don't affect you in your daily life, where they become manageable.” Caplash said.

He says half of his PTSD issues were dealt with after the first round. After three sessions, it felt like 90 per cent.

“It was crazy … to the point where, who I was going into the study was very much not who I was coming out,” he said.

“It's been every day, you know, for the last couple years being suicidal. Constantly wondering, ‘is this the day I'm going to do it?’ And after just that first session … I just wasn't suicidal anymore.”

Despite the stigma, common fears and assumptions about psychedelics, researchers say the drugs are generally not addictive, but they caution people not to try them on their own. They are illegal in Canada and must be done in combination with therapy in a clinical setting under medical supervision.

“These are promising treatments, they need to be studied more, but it's really going to be a huge missed opportunity if these treatments are not made ….accessible broadly,” said Dr. Jordan Sloshower, a professor with the department of psychiatry at Yale University who is collaborating with Williams on new research.

Williams meanwhile, believes psychedelics will be a “game changer” in mental health care and is planning several more studies on the subject, including using Psilocybin and MDMA to treat trauma in racialized people and refugees.

“I think it is going to change the way that we approach and think about people who have problems like trauma and depression and anxiety,” she said.

Caplash is now a mental health advocate and wants others who have gone through similar trauma to know they should never give up, and to treat their mental health seriously.

“I don’t even know if I'd necessarily be alive today if it wasn’t ... for this therapy,” he said.

“When you go from constantly contemplating suicide every second of every day to feeling like I actually have something to live for … that's such a massive change.”"
CTV,Patient hopes Canada will introduce regulations for treatment with 'magic mushrooms',18-Jan-21,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/patient-hopes-canada-will-introduce-regulations-for-treatment-with-magic-mushrooms-1.5270875,"As the first terminally ill cancer patient in Canada to legally use so-called magic mushrooms to treat anxiety, Thomas Hartle is hopeful that more temporary approvals from the federal government signal a permanent regulatory regime may be in the works.

Hartle, 53, received a one-year exemption from the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act last August to use psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, during psychotherapy.

Since then, Health Canada has approved 24 more applications from cancer patients for treatment of end-of-life distress. It has also granted exemptions to 19 health-care providers, giving them the right to possess and use mushrooms containing psilocybin for professional training purposes, a spokeswoman said in a statement. The department has yet to decide whether it will allow the public to use any psychedelics for therapeutic purposes beyond the exemptions it has granted so far.

Hartle has had two psychedelic psychotherapy sessions at his home in Saskatoon, the last one in November, with psilocybin from mushrooms he grew and dried himself using a coffee grinder to turn them into powder and placed into capsules for precise dosages.

The IT administrator, who is on leave from his job, said anxiety over dying from colon cancer and leaving his wife and two children, both on the autism spectrum, became unbearable after his inoperable condition was diagnosed in 2016.

However, taking psilocybin during his two sessions with the help of his regular clinical psychologist helped him manage his anxiety to the point that he hasn't felt the need to have any more psychedelic-assisted therapy while he continues traditional therapy, Hartle said.

""I think that's probably obvious to most people who have interacted with me before and after my sessions,"" he said of the marked improvement in his anxiety through a deeper understanding of the word ""serenity.""

""I've been talking about subjects that I would previously have considered almost impossible to talk about and keep a clear voice and not break down into a very emotional state. Instead of focusing on the pain or discomfort, I'm focusing on making lunch for my family or something like that.""

Before each of the two sessions, Hartle said he met with his therapist and completed paperwork to gauge his anxiety level in order to establish a baseline that could be compared with how he would feel afterwards.

The first session lasted about six hours, during which he took three capsules about an hour apart, containing a total seven grams of psilocybin, he said.

His therapist and a friend remained by his side as he lay blindfolded and wearing a headset while listening to music from a playlist compiled by Johns Hopkins University as part of its research into psychedelics.

Hartle said the range of music, from classical to chanting as well as South American and African beats, elicited different emotions and he saw multiple colours and geometric shapes as he entered ""a state of other,"" which made it impossible for him to recall the names of his family members.

""It was very serene and comforting to me to realize that I could have consciousness and awareness that had nothing whatsoever to do with this existence.""

Hartle said that prior to his cancer diagnosis, he had never used illegal substances and only started taking cannabis oil to deal with the nausea brought on by chemotherapy as part of his cancer treatments.

Focused psychotherapy sessions before, during and after his two sessions were crucial to his use of psilocybin, Hartle said.

""It's not like you take a pill and suddenly everything is fantastic. It doesn't work like that any more than regular therapy does. There is work to be done. There are challenges to face. There are issues that need to be worked through the same as any other session. The main difference is that with the psychedelic-assisted therapy, it can get your ego out of the way so you can get at some things.""

Spencer Hawkswell, CEO of TheraPsil, a Victoria-based advocacy group for patients, said it helped Hartle apply for exemptions to use psilocybin on compassionate grounds based on Canadians' right to medical assistance in dying.

He said access to assistance in dying should also give terminally ill patients the right to try mushrooms to reduce their emotional suffering.

""When we can't manage someone's symptoms, that's often when they choose MAiD. (Psilocybin) deserves to be put in between the treatment options that are failing those patients and MAiD.""

TheraPsil has helped people from six provinces apply for exemptions.

Health-care providers who have received exemptions to use psilocybin themselves before leading psychedelic-assisted sessions include family doctors, nurses, psychologists, psychiatrists, clinical counsellors and social workers, Hawkswell said, adding the group is putting together a training program that will need partnerships with provincial governments.

Psilocybin is just one of several psychedelics being considered to treat mental health conditions while a growing number of private companies promote their potential use for multiple issues including obesity, smoking, alcohol dependence and addiction to illicit substances.

Mark Haden, chair of the board for the Canadian chapter of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS Canada, said psychedelics appear to be seen as the new cannabis before it was legalized.

""A lot of venture capitalists went into the cannabis world. Many of them made money. Some of them lost a huge amount of money, so the cannabis bubble exploded and then burst. So, all of that money is saying, 'Where do we go next? What's the next big thing?' And they've latched their view on psychedelics.""

MAPS Canada is currently conducting a Phase 3 clinical trial in Vancouver on the use of MDMA, commonly known as ecstasy, to treat post-traumatic stress disorder.

Haden said the small trial involving about 12 people is expected to be completed next year as part of the research by over a dozen sites in the United States and Israel.

Traditional PTSD therapy has a high dropout rate, may involve patients taking medication for years and has an effectiveness rate of 10 to 25 per cent, said Haden, who is also an adjunct professor at the University of British Columbia's School of Population and Public Health.

""With MDMA, it takes a few months and the effectiveness is 60 to 80 per cent,"" he said of research findings elsewhere."
CTV,"As medicine rediscovers magic mushrooms, a Montreal clinic says there's no time to waste",20-Nov-20,https://montreal.ctvnews.ca/as-medicine-rediscovers-magic-mushrooms-a-montreal-clinic-says-there-s-no-time-to-waste-1.5198281,"MONTREAL -- Researchers think magic mushrooms will be the future of health care. But how easily and fast regular people will be able to use them is another question -- one a Montreal organization wants to see solved quickly.

“The fact is that a lot of these substances are really safe from a physiological perspective, and even from a psychological perspective,” said Andrew Rose of Mindspace, a mental health-care provider with offices in Westmount, the Plateau and downtown.

“It’s certainly safer than alcohol and a lot of prescription medication that’s out there.""

There is increasing evidence that the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, called psilocybin, has major health benefits for people with severe treatment-resistant depression, PTSD, and addictions. 

A lot of change is suddenly happening behind the scenes, if not yet at your local pharmacy, and a few organizations such as Mindspace are at the forefront of the push. 

A Vancouver-based company called Numinus has become the first in Canada to complete a legal harvest of magic mushrooms in 50 years.

Under Health Canada’s Controlled Drugs and Substances Act, the company was granted a compassionate access clinical trial, which allows it to grow magic mushrooms, extract psilocybin, and refine models of use for psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy.

PART OF BROADER THERAPY

This doesn’t mean people should go source their own magic mushrooms looking for a cure.

“The drug is a part of it, but where the magic happens is in the therapy,” says Payton Nyquvest, the CEO of Numinus.

“I hear people regularly say that one dose of psilocybin-assisted therapy was like 10 years of psychotherapy wrapped into one treatment.”

Nyquvest agrees, and he says he should know. He has spent 10 years attending psychotherapy due to lifelong chronic pain. He says with that after one round of psilocybin-assisted therapy, he hasn't suffered from the chronic pain since.

He uses the analogy of a toboggan going down a hill. Eventually it will create a groove, or trail, in the snow. Those are neurological pathways in our brain.

“So if I have trauma and my way of dealing with that has been addiction, that pathway can get pretty grooved the more I go back to that addiction,"" he said.

""Psychedelics essentially grooms the snow and gives you the ability to create new grooves and new pathways.”

American company Maps has released a report of its phase three clinical trials on MDMA, also a psychedelic, used to treat severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It shows a 70 per cent effective rate after three treatments.

Nyquvest says psychedelics could become a widely used cure for addictions, PTSD, severe depression and other treatment-resistant mental illness.

But first, he says, there needs to be a massive disruption to the current pharmaceutical model before they could become accessible.

“We have to remember that there’s a financial aspect that we’re talking about,” he says. “There are a lot of companies that want people to be on an ongoing, pill-dispensing model because it’s quite profitable.”

'SAFER THAN ALCOHOL'

Montreal-based Mindspace, which includes a clinic, offers workshops to businesses, therapists and more, is a rarity across the country in how much it has integrated psychedelic treatment into much of its work.

The organization's approach is to bring several disciplines together, such as psychiatry, diet, exercise and mindfulness, to support psychedelic treatment. 

Because psychedelics are still illegal in Canada, Mindspace cannot administer the drug during therapy. But their clients often source it themselves and work with one of Mindspace’s 30 therapists on safe use.

Mindspace does not source the drugs or sit with people while they have their experience.

Despite their staff's belief in the drugs' value, making that case to authorities is harder, to hear Rose describe it.

”“There needs to be a way that people who need this treatment can have access to it, and not just people with really great health insurance plans and money,"" said Rose, who directs Mindspace's programming and its psychedelics programs.

“If there isn’t a shift around how we approach mental health care as part of the larger public health-care system, that’s going to be an issue in how accessible this treatment is.""

Rose says two things need to happen. One is for the current health-care system to keep moving forward with research and treatment of psilocybin. Health Canada has made some great strides, he says, including granting Numinus’s clinical trial.

That momentum needs to continue by broadening the regulatory landscape to include psychedelics, allocating more funding into research, and covering mental health under public health, he said.

He believes the next necessary step is decriminalizing illicit drugs. 

“If you want to take care of our population and communities, we need to stop putting people in jail for using drugs to self-medicate, and start focusing on the public health questions.”

HITTING RESTART AFTER 50-YEAR PAUSE

According to Rose, the stigma around magic mushrooms and other psychedelics is “propaganda” that former U.S. President Richard Nixon used in his 1970 war on drugs.

That’s when clinical research into psychedelics came to a halt. The biggest misconception Nixon spread is that psychedelics are addictive, which is not true, Rose says. Psychedelics have little to no addictive properties. 

“The war on drugs was a failure,” he said. “It just needs to be repeated to people that the story they believed in is not the case. And one way is it to see first-hand how these treatments can help.”

Another growing body of research is shifting how we think about well-being and mental health, says Rose.

“It’s changing our understanding of individual, one-on-one therapy and bringing it back to a collective, group therapy.”

Despite the obstacles, he says he fully expects to be offering psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy -- and giving them to his own patients -- in the coming years."
CTV,"The growing push for medical use of psilocybin in Canada
Avis Favaro, Medical Correspondent
",15-Feb-20,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/the-growing-push-for-medical-use-of-psilocybin-in-canada-1.4813886,"TORONTO -- Growing evidence about the powers of psilocybin, a naturally occurring psychedelic compound produced by several species of mushrooms, being used to treat anxiety and depression has inspired advocates to file a federal court challenge next month to allow its use to treat terminally ill patients.

Psychotherapist and professor at the University of Victoria Bruce Tobin has been on the forefront of those advocating to end the prohibition of the drug – highlighting its potential for cancer patients who often suffer from what is described by doctors as “end of life distress.”

End of life distress is a “nasty combination of anxiety, depression hopelessness and demoralization that often accompanies the diagnosis of a terminal illness such as cancer,” Tobin said in an interview with CTV News’ medical correspondent Avis Favaro. “My desire is to get the treatment to patients who are in need of it right now.” Psilocybin found in what is colloquially known as “magic mushrooms” is illegal in Canada, but Tobin said he has witnessed patients undergoing psychotherapy feel calmer and less stressed by using the compound.

“We can see the results in many cases very quickly, as quickly as the next day,” he said.

Tobin says he has been waiting three years for Health Canada to respond to multiple applications for psilocybin’s compassionate use in terminally ill patients.

“My attitude now is treatment delayed is treatment denied,” Tobin said, explaining that he will continue to push for psilocybin to be exempted from the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act.

Three thousand patients per year in Canada are suffering from “end of life distress” and fit the criteria for so-called psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, Tobin said.

His campaign is supported by a group he formed, entitled “TheraPsil:Therapeutic Psilocybin for Canadians,” which lists the scientific, legal and moral reasons the group believes the compound should be made legal for “end of life distress” cases.

Research into the medicinal uses of psilocybin has been growing exponentially.

A U.S. study published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology in January showed that cancer patients who were given the compound reported reductions in anxiety, depression, hopelessness, demoralization and death-related anxiety more than four years after receiving their doses in combination with psychotherapy.

A second study from the U.K. in the Journal of Psychopharmacology suggested that when given to patients with treatment-resistant depression, psilocybin affected “functional connectivity” changes in the brain which was evident in scans. The study suggested that “psilocybin therapy improves how the brain works and revives emotional responsiveness.”

The field of psychedelic research is “very exciting” according to professor Roland Griffiths, director of the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.

Griffiths’ centre was the first to obtain regulatory approval in the U.S. to restart research into psychedelics using healthy volunteers. Previous research into psychedelics met an abrupt end during the war on drugs in the 1970s.

“When we initiated this research there was a fair bit of skepticism on the part of many, my colleagues and certainly regulators, about whether or not this work is safe,” Griffiths said in an interview with CTV News.

Now his research group is publishing an array of studies on the benefits of using one dose of psilocybin in a treatment that runs approximately six hours and has few side effects and displays benefits to patients’ perceptions.

“Psilocybin produces conditions under which people report having a sense of increased efficacy, a change of world view, a sense of change of self, and that they’re able to reengage in the world in very positive ways,” Griffiths said.

Griffiths said that as patients reflect back on those experiences with psilocybin, they “often have this sense of a profound coming to an understanding of a deeper level of who they are.”

With many psychiatric disorders proving difficult to treat, Griffiths said the team at Johns Hopkins is expanding its testing of psilocybin and other psychedelics, such as LSD, for conditions including obsessive compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, opioid use disorder, alcoholism and anorexia nervosa.

Other research is examining the benefits of microdosing, which uses small doses of psilocybin to treat anxiety and depression. A survey of people self-managing mental and substance use disorders by microdosing found 44 per cent of them perceived their mental health was “much better” as a result.

Some Canadians are not waiting for the studies.

Michael Ljubsa of Edmonton, Alta., struggled with depression when he left high school and began university, and said he was unable to find relief with the standard therapies or medications available to him.

“I just became like a zombie basically,” he said in an interview with CTV News. “It became just difficult to function.”

Ljubsa experimented with psilocybin in Jamaica, where it is legal, to try and help – not something doctors recommend – and described a change in self-perception he found “liberating” and boosted his mental wellbeing. He is now an advocate of further psilocybin research.

“Any sort of work that is being done to bring this medicine to people as fast as possible is the work that needs to be done,” Ljubsa said.

At least two centres in Canada are pursuing studies of psilocybin. The University of Toronto Mississauga has launched a Centre for Psychedelic Studies and will host the world’s first clinical trials on microdosing psilocybin. Other related research is planned at the University of British Columbia’s School of Population and Public Health.

“I think we are entering a new era in the treatment of mental health conditions,” Griffiths said.

“Psilocybin and these compounds have mechanisms unlike anything we have seen within our normal treatment options within psychiatry,” he continued. “The potential…to have efficacy across a range of conditions is absolutely remarkable. We just don’t understand the mechanisms of them yet.” "
CTV,Magic mushroom' drug can reduce anxiety and depression for years: study,28-Jan-20,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/magic-mushroom-drug-can-reduce-anxiety-and-depression-for-years-study-1.4786605,"A single dose of psilocybin, a compound found in ""magic mushrooms,"" provides long-term relief of anxiety and depression in cancer patients, a new study finds.

In fact, cancer patients who were given psilocybin reported reductions in anxiety, depression, hopelessness, demoralization, and death anxiety more than four years after receiving the dose in combination with psychotherapy.

""Our findings strongly suggest that psilocybin therapy is a promising means of improving the emotional, psychological, and spiritual well-being of patients with life-threatening cancer,"" said Dr. Stephen Ross, associate professor of psychiatry in the Department of Psychiatry at NYU Langone Health. The findings build on improvements first reported by the team in 2016, in which 29 patients with cancer-related anxiety and depression were given either a single dose of psilocybin or a vitamin placebo called niacin. Seven weeks later, they were given the opposite. This was in combination with nine psychotherapy sessions.

By 6.5 months, after all patients had received psilocybin, about 60 per cent to 80 per cent showed clinically significant reductions in depression, anxiety and existential distress and and improved attitudes toward death.

Fifteen of the original participants were then followed up 3.2 and 4.5 years later and showed sustained long-term improvements, with more than 70 per cent of them further attributing ""positive life change's to the therapy experience, rating it among 'the most personally meaningful and spiritually significant experiences of their lives,"" according to the study published Tuesday in the Journal of Psychopharmacology.

""This approach has the potential to produce a paradigm shift in the psychological and existential care of patients with cancer, especially those with terminal illness,"" Ross said in a statement.

Ross believes an alternative means of treating anxiety and depression among cancer patients is urgently needed, stating that a third of people diagnosed with cancer will developing anxiety, depression and other forms of distress.

Though his team does not fully understand how psilocybin has such effects on the mind, they previously suggested it could be because our brains have a level of neuroplasticity -- the ability to adapt and change with various experiences.

""These results may shed light on how the positive effects of a single dose of psilocybin persist for so long,"" said Gabby Agin-Liebes, lead investigator and lead author of the long-term follow-up study, and co-author of the 2016 parent study. ""The drug seems to facilitate a deep, meaningful experience that stays with a person and can fundamentally change his or her mindset and outlook.""

The study has its limitations, such as the small number of patients monitored in the latest study and its overlap with the previous trial.

""The conclusions that can be drawn are limited because the original trial was a crossover design,"" says James Rucker, who leads the Psychedelic Trials Group at the Centre for Affective Disorders at Kings College London in the U.K. ""This means that in the original trial every participant eventually received psilocybin. Because of this, there is no control group in this current study. This means that we do not know whether the participants might have improved long term anyway, regardless of the treatment.""

The findings do, however, build on growing evidence supporting the benefits of psilocybin on mental health.

""This trial provides some useful reassurance to ongoing clinical trials, particularly in treatment resistant depression,"" added Rucker, who was not involved in the study.

Multiple studies to date have found benefits in using psilocybin to treat people with depression when combined with supportive therapy.

There were an estimated 18 million cases of cancer globally in 2018, according to the World Health Organization, and research has shown depression to be more common among patients with cancer than the general population.

""This could profoundly transform the psycho-oncologic care of patients with cancer, and importantly could be used in hospice settings to help terminally ill cancer patients approach death with improved emotional and spiritual well-being,"" Ross said."
CTV,Former Canopy co-CEO Bruce Linton sees big opportunity in psychedelics,17-Sep-19,https://www.ctvnews.ca/business/former-canopy-co-ceo-bruce-linton-sees-big-opportunity-in-psychedelics-1.4597006,"Canopy Growth Corp.'s co-founder and recently ousted co-chief executive has his eye on a new frontier for medicine beyond cannabis: psychedelics.

Bruce Linton said he will be a director at Mind Medicine, a Toronto-based company that is seeking to establish safe psychedelic-assisted treatments for mental illness, such as medicinal psilocybin and medicinal MDMA.  He sees the opportunity for psychedelics as medicine as similar to the outlook for medicinal cannabis years ago, where regulations were starting to ease in some jurisdictions, opening the door for research.

“There's probably untapped value, which will only go to the people who are at the beginning and bold,” he said in an interview.

Linton is not out of the cannabis business, however, and is taking on advisory roles and making some strategic investments.

He said he will serve as a special adviser to animal health and CBD company Better Choice and executive chairman at recreational dispensary Gage Cannabis Co.

He will also be an activist investor in OG DNA Genetics Inc. and Slang Worldwide Inc., a cannabis consumer packaged goods company whose co-founders also founded Mettrum Health Corp. which was acquired by Canopy in 2017 when it was a public company.

Linton's announcement of his next steps comes after he was terminated in July from the top job at the Smiths Falls, Ont-based cannabis company.

Canopy holds its annual general meeting of shareholders - its first without Linton at the helm - in Toronto on Tuesday.

Although psilocybin and MDMA - better known as the hallucinogen found in so-called magic mushrooms and the party drug ecstasy, respectively - are illegal in Canada and the U.S., researchers are exploring the substances' efficacy in treating conditions such as post-traumatic stress disorder and depression.

Last year, researchers across North America, including B.C., began the third and final stage of experimental psychotherapy trials exploring the use of clinical-grade MDMA, ahead of plans to legalize this type of therapy in Canada and the U.S. by 2021.

Meanwhile, in May, Denver became the first city to decriminalize magic mushrooms, and Oakland followed suit in June.

Earlier this month, the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine in Baltimore announced it will start the Center of Psychedelic and Consciousness Research, which it says is the first of its kind in the U.S. and the largest in the world.

Linton said Mind Medicine has been working on a derivative of psychedelic substances that can provide therapeutic benefits but without causing a high, in the hopes of getting approval from the Food and Drug Administration.

He foresees a “similar run” for psychedelics as cannabis, but doesn't propose that they also become social or recreational products.

“This is clinical research, looking at ingredients that mostly are derived from nature and that haven't been clinically examined. ... Prohibition put up a big barrier, and I want to explore what is behind it now.”

Meanwhile, Linton still has ties to the Canadian cannabis industry. He remains a major shareholder in Canopy, and recently upped his investment in the cannabis firm as it prepares for the legalization of edibles, beverages and other ingestible products later this year.

Although a non-compete clause as part of Linton's abrupt termination bars him from working at another Canadian cannabis company, he is able to take on the advisory roles with Gage and Better Choice.

He also said he “expects to select and announce a multi-state operator for a similar role in the near term.”

Linton said he turned down roles with some of the larger, better known U.S. companies in the cannabis space, as he believes he can make a bigger impact at Mind Medicine, Gage and Better Choice.

“Some of the big ones I think they're doing a terrific job,” he said. “And while they want me, some of them, I think sometimes it's more just to say I'm there rather than to actually know what the hell I do.”"
CTV,U.S. FDA approves nasal spray to treat depression,5-Mar-19,https://www.ctvnews.ca/health/u-s-fda-approves-nasal-spray-to-treat-depression-1.4323965,"WASHINGTON -- A mind-altering medication related to the club drug Special K won U.S. approval Tuesday for patients with hard-to-treat depression, the first in a series of long-overlooked substances being reconsidered for severe forms of mental illness.

The nasal spray from Johnson & Johnson is a chemical cousin of ketamine, which has been used for decades as a powerful anesthetic to prepare patients for surgery. In the 1990s, the medication was adopted as a party drug by the underground rave culture due to its ability to produce psychedelic, out-of-body experiences. More recently, some doctors have given ketamine to people with depression without formal FDA approval.

The Food and Drug Administration approved Spravato as a fast-acting treatment for patients who have failed to find relief with at least two antidepressants. Up to 7.4 million American adults suffer from so-called treatment-resistant depression, which heightens the risk of suicide, hospitalization and other serious harm, according to the FDA. The drug will cost between $590 and $885 depending on the dosage and before various insurance discounts and rebates.

There have been no major pharmaceutical innovations for depression since the launch of Prozac and related antidepressants in the late 1980s. Those drugs target the feel-good brain chemical serotonin, and can take weeks or months to kick in.

Ketamine and J&J's version work differently than those drugs, targeting a chemical called glutamate that is thought to restore brain connections that help relieve depression.

When the drug works, its effect is almost immediate. That speed ""is a huge thing because depressed patients are very disabled and suffer enormously,"" said Dr. John Mann, a psychiatrist and researcher at Columbia University. If the drug doesn't work, physicians can quickly switch to other options, he noted.

The FDA approved Spravato, known chemically as esketamine, based on study results that showed patients taking the drug experienced a bigger improvement in their depression levels than patients taking a sham treatment, when measured with a psychiatric questionnaire.

The drug is designed to be lower-dose and easier to use than ketamine, which is normally given as an intravenous infusion.

Robin Prothro, 60, began taking antidepressants more than 20 years ago. But she says none of the five medications she tried relieved the depression that has stymied her personal and professional life.

Since enrolling in a Spravato trial two years ago, Prothro says her depression has lifted and she's returned to hobbies she abandoned years ago, like gardening.

She takes the drug every two weeks at her psychiatrist's office while reclining in a comfortable chair.

""You can feel it coming on, it's a strong drug,"" she said, describing colours and shapes that drift before her eyes. ""I just let the drug work. I close my eyes and my mind is amazingly quiet.""

PSYCHEDELICS RECONSIDERED

The ketamine-like drug is the first of several psychoactive substances making their way through the U.S. regulatory process as physicians search further afield for new therapies. Researchers are conducting late-stage trials of psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, and MDMA, a euphoria-inducing club drug, as potential treatments for depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.

""Substantially different agents are only rarely appearing from pharmaceutical companies or other laboratories,"" said Dr. Paul Summergrad, a psychiatrist at Tufts University. ""That's prompting people to investigate other compounds.""

Unlike ketamine, psilocybin and MDMA have no legal medical use. Classified in the same category as heroin and LSD, they are tightly restricted by the federal government. But the FDA's approval of esketamine could smooth their path.

BURDEN OF DEPRESSION

Depression is among the leading causes of disability in the U.S. and is being closely monitored by health authorities amid rising suicides nationwide. In 2017, the U.S. suicide rate rose to 14 deaths per 100,000 people, the highest rate in at least 50 years, according to federal records.

Government officials haven't suggested an explanation for the trend, though academic researchers point to the nation's widening income gap, financial struggles and divisive politics.

J&J's drug will be subject to a number of restrictions due to its abuse potential, side effects and lingering safety questions.

The drug will only be given by accredited specialists who must monitor patients for at least two hours after administration, due to its trippy, disorienting effects. Additionally, all patients will be tracked in a registry to monitor long-term safety and effectiveness.

The immediate impact of ketamine is thought to last just four to seven days and there's no consensus yet on how long patients can benefit from ongoing treatment.

Still, there are few other options for patients who fail to respond to antidepressants. The most effective treatment in such cases, electroshock therapy, requires patients to be fully sedated and can cause persistent memory loss.

Wall Street has high expectations for J&J's medication, with analysts predicting more than $600 million in annual sales by 2022. But J&J will face competition in the marketplace.

A decades-old drug, ketamine is already used off-label to treat depression by some doctors. At least 150 clinics around the U.S. provide treatment with various forms of the drug, which is available as a low-cost generic. Patients often pay hundreds or thousands of dollars for intravenous infusions of the drug over several weeks or months. Such therapies are generally not covered by insurance because they haven't been approved as safe and effective by FDA regulators.

Some doctors plan to offer both ketamine and the new J&J drug.

Dr. Steve Levine says having FDA-approved standards for dosing and administering the new drug should raise standards in the field and drive out some of the bad actors who are not qualified to treat depression.

""This is going to bring in some standards, regulation and it's going to make it safer and more accessible to patients,"" said Levine, who serves as vice-president of the American Society of Ketamine Physicians, a group representing doctors, nurses and others using ketamine for treating depression or other nonapproved uses."
