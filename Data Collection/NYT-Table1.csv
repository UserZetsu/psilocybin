NYT,Can Psychedelics Be Therapy? Allow Research to Find Out,17-Jul-17,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/17/upshot/can-psychedelics-be-therapy-allow-research-to-find-out.html?searchResultPosition=1,"In the last few years, calls for marijuana to be researched as a medical therapy have increased. It may be time for us to consider the same for psychedelic drugs.

Two general classes of such drugs exist, and they include LSD, psilocybin, mescaline and ecstasy (MDMA).

All are illegal in the United States because they carry a high risk of abuse. They can also cause harm. The best-known adverse event is persistent flashbacks, though these are believed to be rare. More common are symptoms like increased heart rate and blood pressure, anxiety and panic.

Some people have pointed to anecdotal evidence of positive effects. Ayelet Waldman, a novelist and former federal public defender, wrote a   memoir about how microdosing of the drugs turned her life around. But these drugs — like all drugs —   carry risks that should not be ignored. With plenty of potential downsides, and no proven upsides, it’s not surprising that such drugs have been shunned.

In recent years, however, research has begun to show promise in treating a number of ailments.

People with life-threatening illnesses can also suffer from anxiety, which is hard to treat, especially when patients are on many other medications. In 2014, a small randomized controlled trial was published that examined if LSD could be used to improve this anxiety. The treatment included two LSD-assisted psychotherapy sessions conducted two to three weeks apart. Anxiety was significantly reduced in the intervention group for up to a year. Such results, however, could have been due in part to a placebo effect.

More common are studies of the use of psychedelics to treat abuse or addiction to other substances. A 2012 meta-analysis of studies exploring LSD’s potential to treat alcoholism looked at six randomized controlled trials. They included more than 500 patients, with follow-up of three to 12 months. The interventions usually involved one dose of LSD, given in a supervised setting, coupled with therapy. Alcohol use and misuse were significantly reduced in the LSD group for six months; differences seemed to disappear by one year. Similar studies   using psilocybin have also shown promising results.

There was an open label study — meaning there’s no placebo or attempt to mask treatment information — of three doses of psilocybin as part of a tobacco cessation program. It found that 12 of 15 participants (who had smoked an average of more than 30 years) remained abstinent six months after the program began and 16 weeks after their last treatment. That’s a much higher rate than seen in traditional programs to help people quit smoking.

Other uses might exist as well. Researchers examined the potential for MDMA in the treatment of chronic and treatment-resistant post-traumatic stress disorder. At two months after therapy, more than 80 percent of those in the treatment group saw a clinical improvement versus only 25 percent of those in the placebo group. These researchers later   followed up with participants in the study, and found that the beneficial effects lasted for at least four years, even with no further treatment with psychedelics.   Similar studies have also seen improvements in symptom scores.

As with marijuana, though, studies like these are the exception, not the rule. It is very, very difficult to do research on psychedelic compounds because they, like pot, are classified as Schedule I controlled substances, meaning they have a very high potential for misuse and no accepted uses. Schedule II drugs also have a high potential for abuse, but are considered to have potential benefits. These include OxyContin, fentanyl, Percocet and even opium.

To engage in research in Schedule I drugs, scientists have to get approval from the Drug Enforcement Administration. To obtain a license, research labs must have inspections to prove that they are capable of storing the drugs and protecting them from misuse. In Britain, the added costs of licensing and security can cost a lab about £5,000 a year, or nearly $6,500. Unfortunately, the costs in the United States are not as well documented.

Because of this, much of the research on these drugs is old; a lot of it took place before the United States and other countries categorized these drugs in the 1960s. What research has occurred since has often taken place in countries that are more permissive in their experiments.

Given the potential dangers inherent in these drugs, it’s important to stress that research would need to be closely monitored. Although the drugs are relatively safe compared with substances like heroin or cocaine, and aren’t nearly as addicting, they still pose psychological and physical risks.

People with a family or personal history of psychotic or psychiatric disorders should be particularly wary, and perhaps be excluded from trials. Research requires safety monitoring, careful planning and significant support throughout. We need to watch carefully for adverse outcomes, both expected and unexpected. We need to make sure protocols are transparent and reproducible.

We also need to acknowledge that we need more research before anyone attempts to use these drugs as medicine. They’re typically coupled with professional therapy in studies, and we still aren’t sure there are benefits.

But it may be time to time to reconsider our current classification of controlled substances. Clearly we must continue to be vigilant about whether drugs pose physical harm to patients. But we could assess drugs using additional measurements, including the potential for dependence; social costs through damaged family and social life; and financial costs through health care, social care and the need for police involvement.

Using these metrics, it’s hard to argue that alcohol and tobacco should be legal for adults while marijuana and psychedelics should be considered so dangerous they’re hard to study. Likewise, opioids are considered widely acceptable in practice, yet appear to do far more harm.

With the potential to help curb more serious addictions and ease the symptoms of mental illnesses, it seems odd to continue to make it nearly impossible to research the therapeutic potential of psychedelics."
NYT,‘A Hail Mary’: Psychedelic Therapy Draws Veterans to Jungle Retreats,30-Aug-20,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/30/world/americas/psychedelics-therapy-war-stress.html?searchResultPosition=2,"Ayahuasca, a vomit-inducing hallucinogenic brew, draws thousands of people each year — including former soldiers — to jungle retreats that have become an unlicensed and unregulated mental health marketplace.

GIGANTE, Costa Rica — There was a ghostlike quality to Rudy Gonsior, an American former Special Forces sniper, on the morning he arrived at a jungle retreat to see if a vomit-inducing psychedelic brew could undo the damage years of combat had done to his mind.

Glassy-eyed and withdrawn, he barely spoke above a whisper and was much quieter than the six other veterans who had come to dredge up painful memories of comrades fallen in battle, thoughts of suicide and the scar that taking a life leaves on the psyche.

“I have traveled across continents to come to the jungle to do psychedelics,” marveled Mr. Gonsior, who had steered clear from drugs his whole life. “I guess this is what might be considered a Hail Mary.”

They had come to western Costa Rica to try ayahuasca, a substance people in the Amazon rainforest have imbibed for centuries. Some Indigenous communities regard the brew, which contains the hallucinogen DMT, as a powerful medicine that keeps them spiritually resilient and in harmony with the natural world.

The lodge the Americans visited late last year was a far cry from that, with a gleaming swimming pool and a sprawling deck that anchors well-appointed cabanas featuring splendid ocean views. Charging from $2,875 to $6,900 per person for weeklong retreats, the lodge is among the newest and priciest additions to a booming alternative healing sector.

Until relatively recently, only a few botanists, hippies and spiritual seekers gained access to the world of Amazon shamanism, which missionaries drove underground during colonization in much of the Amazon basin as they sought to convert Indigenous groups to Christianity.

But now, thousands of people from around the world make pilgrimages each year to the more than 140 ayahuasca retreat centers in Latin American countries where the substance’s use in ceremonial settings is legal or, as in Costa Rica, not explicitly outlawed.

Besides psychedelic ceremonies, which are often physically and emotionally draining, retreat organizers offer group therapy sessions, yoga classes, art therapy, meditation circles and warm floral baths.

Collectively, these centers have become an unlicensed and unregulated mental health marketplace for people searching for an alternative to antidepressants and other widely prescribed pharmaceuticals.

The draw of psychedelics has surged amid a growing body of scientific research that builds on promising studies in the United States and Europe from the 1960s and 1970s. Much of that earlier research was shut down after psychoactive substances were outlawed during the Vietnam War era — a response to concerns over widespread drug use on college campuses.

But in the last few years, the Food and Drug Administration designated psilocybin, the psychedelic component in what are commonly called magic mushrooms, and MDMA, the drug known as ecstasy, as “breakthrough therapies.” That rare designation allows scientists to fast-track larger studies that could pave the way to administering psychedelics as medicine.

Drinking ayahuasca can be dangerous, especially while taking certain pharmaceuticals, including antidepressants and hypertension drugs. It can also set off psychotic episodes for people with serious mental health conditions, like schizophrenia.

And while some retreats have strict rules and protocols that have been developed in consultation with medical professionals, the ayahuasca boom has sometimes been exploited by scammers and charlatans, and it has come under scrutiny for instances of sexual assault on vulnerable or impaired participants, including cases in Peru.

“You have to recognize that there’s a Wild West element” to ayahuasca retreats, said Dr. Matthew Johnson, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Johns Hopkins University who has studied psychedelics since 2004.

In a controlled setting, he said, unleashing the brain can help patients revisit repressed trauma and generate new insights. So the medical establishment, once deeply skeptical of the therapeutic potential of psychedelics, is embracing “what is essentially a new area of medicine,” he added.

But Dr. Johnson worried that psychedelic retreats in general may be ill equipped to screen people for whom trips can be dangerous. In extreme cases, people have tried to commit suicide while high on psychedelics or experienced psychotic episodes that required hospitalization.

“These are powerful, powerful tools and they can put people in a very vulnerable place,” Dr. Johnson said. “That is not to be underestimated.”

Still, the growing buzz around psychedelic-assisted healing, which has been amplified by authors, celebritiesand influential podcast hosts, has put places like the Soltara Healing Center, where the veterans went, at the forefront of a push to challenge conventional mental health care.

Melissa Stangl, a co-founder of Soltara, argued that responsibly run ayahuasca centers could be the seeds of a transformation.

“We are on the cusp of bringing psychoactive medicines into the mainstream health care system,” she said. “Once science really catches up to just how effective that is for people who aren’t being served by the current medical system, we can become allies.”

Before their first ayahuasca ceremony, the veterans met individually with two Peruvian “maestros,” or healers, from the Shipibo community in Peru.

“Their hearts are hardened,” said Teobaldo Ochavano, who helps run the nighttime ceremonies alongside his wife, Marina Sinti. “They seemed unable to experience love or joy.”

Ms. Sinti said years of interacting with foreigners on retreats had made it painfully clear why these rituals are in such high demand.

“People in the United States and Europe are very disconnected,” she said. “From each other and from the Earth.”

‘A Cult of Death’

Like many service members of his generation, Mr. Gonsior said he enlisted in the Marine Corps to avenge the attacks of Sept. 11, which happened when he was in high school.

In 2006, he said he deployed to western Iraq for the first of multiple combat tours. He and his men were constantly ambushed with powerful roadside bombs and shot at by snipers, he said, and 17 service members he deployed with returned home in body bags.

The experience, Mr. Gonsior said, turned him into a ruthless warrior.

“My sole goal was to survive,” he said. “I did a lot of things that I am not particularly proud of.”

Instead of relief for surviving, he felt a crushing sense of shame.

“It was just by dumb luck that I wasn’t shot and wasn’t blown up,” he said. “Like to the point where, statistically, I should be dead by now or at least seriously injured.”

In 2007, Mr. Gonsior said he joined the Army Special Forces, where he served as a sniper. It left him feeling that he had joined a “cult of death,” he said.

“The last 17 years of my life, my job in one way or another has revolved around death,” he said. “As I get older, it weighs heavy.”

Killing became mundane. But one life he took in Afghanistan in 2012 haunted him for years.

During a routine operation, Mr. Gonsior opened fire on a man on a motorcycle, believing he was an insurgent. Soon after, Mr. Gonsior learned he had killed an Afghan intelligence source working with his unit.

Mr. Gonsior said he didn’t allow himself to grieve that death properly or process the guilt until years later, when he was gripped by depression and bouts of rage that were sometimes set off by inconsequential things his children did.

Abstract thoughts about suicide eventually turned chillingly specific, he said. At the Veterans Affairs hospital where he sought help, Mr. Gonsior, 35, said he was urged to take antidepressants. He said he refused, based on the side effects he had seen fellow soldiers suffer.

Last year, after listening to a story about ayahuasca and trauma on the radio, he became fascinated by the idea that healing deep wounds requires grappling with their roots.

“There’s a lot of emotional wreckage, shipwrecks that are kind of down there,” he said.

By the time he and the other veterans filed into the darkened ceremony room, with its netted windows and cone-shaped roof, they had signed a lengthy hold-harmless agreement.

It warned of the “unlikely event of a psychotic episode,” the danger of drinking ayahuasca while taking antidepressants, and that psychedelic trips leave some people feeling worse “mentally, physically and emotionally.”

Dressed in traditional outfits, the Peruvian maestros blew tobacco smoke into the candlelit room, known as a maloca. Participants sitting on cots arranged in a circle stepped up to gulp a shot glass of the dark brown, sludgy ayahuasca brew.

Chris Sutherland, a 36-year-old Canadian soldier who said he recently retired on full disability for post-traumatic stress disorder, had come after years of panic attacks, binge drinking and periods of taking antidepressants that left him feeling that “I was no longer human.”

David Radband, a British former special forces soldier, said he came to the jungle hoping to drown out the rage that had consumed his life after he left the army. He said it had cost him custody of his children, landed him in prison for assault and pushed him to try to kill himself twice, once by hanging and once by stabbing himself in the gut.

“I was blocking emotions with anger,” said Mr. Radband, 34. “I was putting up a wall all the time.”

Juliana Mercer, 38, a Marine veteran, said she developed a condition called caregiver fatigue after spending four years looking after wounded service members in San Diego. When she deployed to Afghanistan in 2010, she said she experienced crippling fear every time she saw young, healthy Marines drive off the base.

“I was just so desperate to keep everybody safe,” she said.

It was quiet in the room when the maestros blew out the candles, save for the gentle lapping of waves from the nearby beach. But the silence was short-lived.

As the ayahuasca began taking hold, the Peruvians began pacing across the room slowly as they sang Icaros, high-pitched songs that the Shipibo regard as the crux of the healing process.

At times, their rhythm and cadence can be soothing and hypnotic, lullaby-like. But higher notes and fast-pace sequences can feel taunting or exasperating.

When ceremonies reach a crescendo, the room often feels like a state of controlled pandemonium. Bouts of loud vomiting pierce the singing. There is sometimes audible weeping in one corner and ecstatic laughter from across the room.

As dawn approaches and the ayahuasca starts wearing off, participants emerge from the room looking gaunt and dazed as the rational mind struggles to regain control.

“These experiences have a way of completely blasting people out of the mental ruts they’re stuck in and to look at a broader set of possibilities,” said Dr. Johnson at Johns Hopkins, one of several universities conducting clinical trials.

Unlike antidepressants, which numb symptoms of distress when effective, psychedelics appear to turbocharge the kind of healing process that results from psychotherapy, he added.

But he and other experts who cite the psychiatric promise of psychedelics worry about their use in retreats or other settings without adequate controls.

“The room for error is not having adequate medical support” in the rare instances when people have serious adverse effects, said Collin Reiff, a psychiatrist at New York University.

Still, Jesse Gould, a former Army Ranger who brought the veterans to Soltara, says the benefits of the jungle retreat experience outweigh the risks.

Mr. Gould said he created the Heroic Hearts Project, a nonprofit group that raises money to send veterans to psychedelic retreats, after stumbling into one at a low point in his life.

After leaving the Army and traveling a bit, he said he landed a comfortable job in finance that drove him to drink heavily and left him with “a feeling of dread about everything.”

When he sought help at the Department of Veterans Affairs in Tampa, where he lived, Mr. Gould said he was encouraged to take antidepressants, which held no appeal to him. In 2016, he quit his job and booked a retreat at a center in Peru.

The decision was radically out of character for Mr. Gould, 33, a strait-laced veteran who said he had avoided drugs his whole life.

“I definitely grew up in the D.A.R.E. generation,” he said, referring to the antidrug advertising campaign that began in the 1980s. “I was very much into ‘Just say no.’”

His first few ceremonies were brutal, Mr. Gould said, calling them “an all-out war” in which he vomited as many as 20 times in one night and felt like he was pushed “to the edge of sanity.”

But in the months that followed, he said his depression mellowed, his crippling social anxiety melted away and his mood swings, which had felt like a “tug of war in my brain,” ceased.

“It seemed to almost rewire my brain,” Mr. Gould said.

Since then, Mr. Gould and his team have raised more than $250,000 to pay for psychedelic retreat “scholarships” for dozens of veterans. And they have infused the movement to decriminalize psychedelics with testimonies that belie the stereotype of New Age stoners.

“People instantly have the image of a hippie,” he said. “But because of my service, a lot of people that are in a completely different demographic tend to listen.”

‘Another Layer of Understanding’

As their weeklong retreat came to an end, Mr. Radband, the British soldier, said the ceremonies had reignited his desire to live.

“You know, I tried to kill myself twice, but I’m not ready to die,” he said. “I have so much more to give.”

Mr. Sutherland, the Canadian, said one of the ceremonies had been “the most terrifying night of my life, more terrifying than any combat I have ever been in.” But collectively, he said, the trips helped him overcome a longstanding fear: “I am not a sociopath,” he said.

“I was always worried that I was evil, but I was shown where my compassion lies,” he said.

Mr. Gonsior, the American sniper, likened the experience to a “final surrender” that was grueling but restorative.

“You have so many experiences that run the gamut from absolute terror to pure joy,” he said. “You realize there’s another layer of understanding there.”

On the last day, as Mr. Gonsior was waxing poetic about the universe and how all living beings are connected, Mr. Gould couldn’t resist getting in a little jab.

“There’s a hippie inside every veteran,” he said."
NYT,Michael Pollan: Not So Fast on Psychedelic Mushrooms,10-May-19,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/10/opinion/denver-mushrooms-psilocybin.html?searchResultPosition=3,"Only a few days ago, millions of Americans probably had never heard of psilocybin, the active agent in psychedelic mushrooms, but thanks to Denver, it is about to get its moment in the political sun. On Tuesday, the city’s voters surprised everyone by narrowly approving a ballot initiative that effectively decriminalizes psilocybin, making its possession, use or personal cultivation a low-priority crime.

The move is largely symbolic — only 11 psilocybin cases have been prosecuted in Denver in the last three years, and state and federal police may still make arrests — but it is not without significance. A measure legalizing psilocybin therapy is likely to be   on the ballot in Oregon in 2020, and activists in California are mounting a second campaign to get a decriminalization measure on the ballot there. For the first time since psychedelics were broadly banned under the 1970 Controlled Substances Act, we’re about to have a national debate about the place of psilocybin in our society. Debate is always a good thing, but I worry that we’re not quite ready for this one.

No one should ever be arrested or go to jail for the possession or cultivation of any kind of mushroom — it would be disingenuous for me to say otherwise, since I have possessed, used and grown psilocybin myself. Like many others, I was inspired to do so by the recent renaissance of research into psychedelics, including psilocybin.

Scientists at places such as Johns Hopkins, New York University, U.C.L.A.-Harbor Medical Center and Imperial College in London have conducted small but rigorous studies that suggest a single psilocybin trip guided by trained professionals has the potential to relieve “   existential distress” in cancer patients; break addictions to cigarettes, alcohol and cocaine; and bring relief to people struggling with depression. Psychiatry’s current drugs for treating these disorders are limited in their effectiveness, often addictive, address only symptoms and come with serious side effects, so the prospect of psychedelic medicine is raising hopes of a badly needed revolution in mental health care.

This might help explain why the Food and Drug Administration granted “breakthrough therapy” status last year to psilocybin, which promises to speed its consideration as a treatment for depression. But the research also shows that psilocybin may have value for the rest of us: Studies have demonstrated that, properly administered, a psilocybin journey can have enduring, positive effects on the well-being and relative openness of “healthy normals,” as researchers put it.

This is all very exciting, especially coming at a time when rates of depression, suicide and addiction are rising. But the history of psychedelics has been marked by periods of both irrational exuberance and equally irrational stigmatization, so a few cautionary notes are in order. As much as the supporters of legal psilocybin hope to follow the political playbook that has rapidly changed the status of cannabis in recent years, they need to bear in mind that psilocybin is a very different drug, and it is not for everyone.

In some ways, psilocybin is a remarkably safe drug — there is no known lethal dose (something that can’t be said for many medicines sold without a prescription) and it is nonaddictive. But there are risks, both practical and psychological, and these can be serious. Someone on a high dose of psilocybin is apt to have badly impaired judgment and, unsupervised, can do something reckless. Without proper attention to setting and preparation, people can have absolutely terrifying experiences, sometimes with lasting effects; a recent survey of people who reported having a “bad trip” found that nearly 8 percent of them had sought psychiatric help afterward.

There’s a reason psychedelic researchers screen volunteers carefully, excluding people at risk of serious mental illness like schizophrenia; in rare instances, a psychedelic trip can set off a psychotic break. The researchers also look at drug interactions, and often disqualify volunteers who are taking certain psychiatric medications.

I look forward to the day when psychedelic medicines like psilocybin, having proven their safety and efficacy in F.D.A.-approved trials, will take their legal place in society, not only in mental health care but in the lives of people dealing with garden-variety unhappiness or interested in spiritual exploration and personal growth.

My worry is that ballot initiatives may not be the smartest way to get there. We still have a lot to learn about the immense power and potential risk of these molecules, not to mention the consequences of unrestricted use. It would be a shame if the public is pushed to make premature decisions about psychedelics before the researchers have completed their work. There is, too, the risk of inciting the sort of political backlash that, in the late 1960s,   set back research into psychedelics for decades. Think of what we might know now, and the suffering that might have been alleviated, had that research been allowed to continue.

When psychedelics like psilocybin and LSD burst upon the scene in the 1950s and 1960s, they arrived without an instruction manual. Half a century later we’re still struggling to learn how best to harness their spooky power. One source of wisdom on that question is other cultures with much longer experience using these medicines. (Just this week, archaeologists reported finding a 1,000-year-old set of tools in Bolivia bearing trace amounts of ayahuasca and other psychoactive chemicals.)

Whether in pre-Conquest South or Central America (where psilocybin has been used for centuries), or Ancient Greece, psychedelic substances were always approached with deliberateness and care. For the most part, the substances were not taken alone but usually in a group under the direction of an elder or shaman familiar with the mental territory, and they were used only on certain occasions, surrounded by ritual and with a clear intention. There was nothing casual about it.

We would do well to keep that in mind in the years ahead, as we begin the work of figuring out how to make the most constructive use of these astonishing gifts of nature."
NYT,Can Magic Mushrooms Heal Us?,18-Mar-21,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/opinion/oregon-psychedelic-therapy.html?searchResultPosition=5,"A very promising mental health experiment is taking shape in Oregon.

Gov. Kate Brown of Oregon announced the members of the state's newly formed Psilocybin Advisory Board this week. Why does Oregon need an official board to offer advice about the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, you ask? Because Oregon is about to become the first state in the country to try to build a support infrastructure through which psychedelic mushrooms can be woven into everyday life. This framework is different from what we've seen before: not legalization, not medicalization, but therapeutic use, in licensed facilities, under the guidance of professionals trained to guide psychedelic experiences. Whoa.

''Like many, I was initially skeptical when I first heard of Measure 109,'' Brown said in a statement. ''But if we can help people suffering from PTSD, depression, trauma and addiction -- including veterans, cancer patients, and others -- supervised psilocybin therapy is a treatment worthy of further consideration.''

[Listen to ''The Ezra Klein Show,'' a podcast about ideas that matter.]

Measure 109, the Oregon Psilocybin Services Act, approved as a ballot measure in November, is the brainchild of Tom and Sheri Eckert, who shared a therapy practice in Portland. In 2015, the Eckerts read an article by Michael Pollan in The New Yorker titled ''The Trip Treatment.'' The article described the emerging research around using psychedelics as a therapeutic tool and unearthed the largely forgotten pre-Timothy Leary period in which psychedelics were widely used by psychiatrists. In the past, the government had funded more than a hundred studies, and as Pollan recounts in ''How to Change Your Mind,'' his subsequent book, Anaïs Nin, Jack Nicholson and Cary Grant all underwent LSD-assisted therapy. Bill Wilson, a co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous, who'd given up drinking with the aid of a hallucinogenic plant called belladonna, considered bringing LSD-assisted therapy into AA in the 1950s, but was met with disapproval from his board.

This was a very different model of psychedelic use: There was a trained mental health professional in the room and subsequent therapy to help turn the insights into action. The early results were promising, though the studies were poorly designed. At times, the fear was that the compounds were too powerful and left people too malleable to the suggestions of their guide. One early practitioner worried that on psychedelics, ''the fondest theories of the therapist are confirmed by his patient,'' and that even though the healing was real, the pathway was ''nihilistic,'' bordering on something like hypnosis. This era of study ended before these questions could be resolved, when psychedelics slipped into the counterculture, where they were used without therapeutic safeguards, and the Nixon administration targeted them as part of its culture war. A remnant of healers who used psychedelics in their work remained, but they were driven underground.

The Eckerts had personal experience with psilocybin, and Pollan's piece, and the research it led them to, made sense to them as therapists. This was work they could do, should do, but the law made it impossible. ''It was a desire to specialize in this field, and we realized we couldn't,'' Tom Eckert told me. ''And then the question was: Would we accept that answer or were we going to do something about it?''

Sheri Eckert passed away unexpectedly, after a surgery in December, but Tom recounted a hike they had taken together before embarking on what they knew would be a consuming, multiyear political project. ''We decided to consult the mushroom,'' he said. They drove to Mount Rainier, hiked through the woods and took psilocybin over a campfire. Tom found his mind wandering to the far future, when historians would look back on our era. ''I got to thinking that they probably wouldn't care so much about our politics and technologies,'' he said. ''They'd probably notice how estranged and detached we are from our own consciousness.'' The couple couldn't have children but Tom remembers Sheri's voice piercing the quiet. ''An idea could be like a child,'' she said.

This is where I should stop for a moment, before I lose you. The only thing worse than hearing about someone else's dream is hearing about their mushrooms trip. But these experiences have an unusual power, a power Oregon is trying to harness. ''The definition of personality is it's a trait, it doesn't change,'' Matthew Johnson, a professor psychiatry at Johns Hopkins University and the associate director of its Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research, told me. But Johnson has conducted multiple studies in which participants ranging from the very ill to so-called healthy-normals report profound changes to outlook and even personality after one well-facilitated dose.

In particular, traits revolving around openness to change and uncertainty seem to loosen, with people questioning their own judgments, holding other viewpoints and tolerating more ambiguity with greater ease. Openness to new experiences tends to diminish as we age, so the potential of psychedelics to unlatch the windows of the mind is, in Johnson's words, ''a bit of a fountain of youth effect.'' Psilocybin is also a reliable generator of profound, mystical experiences in people who try it with the right intentions and the right support -- experiences that, months and years later, many recall as among the most meaningful of their lives. ''Until our work with psilocybin, there was never an experimental manipulation which you could schedule for a Thursday and change your personality,'' Johnson told me.

But the more pressing case for psilocybin comes from research out of Johns Hopkins, U.C.L.A., N.Y.U. and elsewhere that has shown it to be a potentially effective treatment for major depression, end-of-life anxiety and drug addiction. ''One of the things I've come to is that addiction medicine in 2021 is in desperate need of transformative technologies,'' Todd Korthuis, a professor of medicine who specializes in addiction at Oregon Health & Science University and a member of Oregon's Psilocybin Advisory Board, told me. The studies so far are preliminary, but they are ''showing dramatic change in people's lives -- that's what we need for cocaine use disorder, methamphetamine use disorder, even alcohol and tobacco.''

Some of the early results are so remarkable that they fall into the too-good-to-be-believed category, at least until far more research is done. A recent study on major depressive disorder, published in JAMA Psychiatry, found more than half of the subjects in remission four weeks later, after just two treatments alongside psychotherapy. A study on tobacco addiction, out of Johns Hopkins, found two-thirds of the subjects who received psilocybin in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy abstinent a year later. These would be miraculous effect sizes if they hold up in larger samples and other contexts. Even if further research finds psilocybin only 50 percent as effective as these experiments suggest, it would be still be a breakthrough.

There isn't a simple explanation for why psychedelics possess these powers. M.R.I. scans show the psychedelic brain aflame with activity, with areas that rarely connect lighting up in electric conversation. ''I think that's what's responsible for this radically different associative net, this different ability to absorb the gestalt,'' Johnson told me. You are hearing, thinking, processing differently than normal, which can lead to new experiences and epiphanies. Some of those are classic psychedelia, the kind of thing visualized in ''Yellow Submarine.'' Synesthesia, for instance, where you'll hear in colors. But just as often, the experience defies those expectations: It's more like a difficult, but powerful, therapy session.

I avoided psychedelics when I was younger, fearful of the loss of control, and tried them later, desperately, when there was more darkness in my mind than light. It was not an easy time for me, and these were not easy experiences. They kicked down doors around my anxiety, my marriage, my work, my family, my resentments, my attachments, my self. Those rooms were often unpleasant to enter. There was ecstasy and beauty, yes, but also fear and, often, so often, intense nausea. Things I'd fought to ignore resurfaced. Disparate parts of my life and beliefs and personality connected, and I became more legible to myself. I am not cleansed of anxiety, but I am more aware that my outlook, at any given moment, is just a dance of brain chemistry and experience, and far from the only state possible. That a few micrograms of chemical was all it took to upend my confident grip on reality shook me in ways I'm grateful for. I hold my judgments and worldviews more lightly, and I am friendlier to mystery and strangeness.

But as with more traditional therapy, to the extent that these experiences changed me, it is because I acted on the insights later, once sobriety had returned. A trip is of little value if you refuse to leave the hotel after you arrive. ''You can have an amazing experience, but if you don't do the work to ground it in a practice of self-development, it may not have the impact you would hope,'' Eckert told me. It ''can fade, like a dream.''

Or it can crack you. Psilocybin isn't addictive, and there is no known lethal dose. ''If you look at the safety profile of psilocybin, it's dead last in terms of its risk of harm either to self or others,'' Korthuis told me. But these experiences can be psychologically searing, even scarring. There is evidence that terror-filled trips can cause lingering trauma or even trigger psychosis or suicide in rare cases. Looking back, I wish I had had the option of skilled support, both to get more out of the experiences and to protect me from harm. These are not trivial chemicals. Here there be dragons.

The Eckerts wanted to bring back not the louche psychedelic use of the late '60s and '70s, but the supported psychedelic use of the '50s and early '60s. ''We wanted to put psychedelic therapy and wellness on its own foundation,'' Tom told me. Under Measure 109, no one will be able to walk into a store and buy magic mushrooms. Instead, there will be regulated centers, with trained and licensed facilitators who are there both for the trip itself and to help people integrate the experience afterward. There will be screening for psychological and physical conditions that could make the experience unsafe and help on-site for anyone who does fall into psychological or physical crisis. ''We wanted to think deeply about how we might integrate psychedelics back into the culture,'' Eckert said.

The Eckerts' initiative caught the attention of a broader group of organizations trying to shift the laws around psychedelics. They were invited to present at a meeting of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS. There, they met with other key groups that would become backers of their project: David Bronner, the chief executive of Dr. Bronner's soaps, which uses some of its profits to support drug reform initiatives, and Graham Boyd, a co-founder of the Psychedelic Science Funders Collaborative, who brought his experience winning ballot initiative campaigns to the effort.

MAPS, which is led by its founder, Rick Doblin, is at the center of the decades-long effort to revive research into the medical benefits of psychedelics and is currently deep in F.D.A. trials to get MDMA, an empathogenic chemical associated with the drug ecstasy, approved as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder. Doblin supports the Oregon initiative, but he is cautious about the difficulties inherent in getting it right. How will facilitators be trained? How will patients be screened? Psilocybin remains illegal at the federal level, and the federal government could choose to act on that at any time, he noted. In the early years of state cannabis legalization, there were raids on dispensaries. ''I worry those with the most at stake in terms of licenses will be fearful of participating, when those are the people we most want to participate,'' Doblin told me.

Lurking in Doblin's comments is a concern I heard from many reformers working to change the legal status of psychedelics: Too much, too fast could imperil decades of hard work and steady progress. A few stories, even exaggerated ones, of harmful trips and incompetent or predatory facilitators, could turn this into a rerun of the '70s, when society turned sharply against these substances. ''There's a real Achilles' heel,'' Boyd told me. ''Public opinion can really turn against this. Just because you've got science on your side doesn't mean public policy will follow.'' It was his influence, in part, that got a two-year implementation process included in the ballot initiative, where regulators and scientists could come together to carefully devise the program and to roll it out slowly, with plenty of public education and legal consideration.

What's striking to me about Measure 109, though, is that it breaks away from the medicalization-legalization binary that has defined drug reform for the past few decades. It does not allow anyone to sell psilocybin pills in stores. Nor does it restrict treatment to those with a diagnosis of mental illness. The measure does not grudgingly accept psilocybin as the lesser evil compared with, say, the drug war or PTSD. Instead, it is based on the idea that psilocybin has the potential to change our lives for the good, whether we are sick or well, and so it is worth investing in the frameworks and safeguards so that it can be used safely and productively. It would be foolish to posit psilocybin-assisted therapy as an answer to all that ails our society, or even our mental health system. But it would be one more option for those who need it, and both evidence and anecdote suggest it would be life-changing for many. That would be enough. That would be so much.

''Oregon has always been a pioneer state,'' Korthuis told me. ''It's been a hotbed of innovation around drug policy for at least 25 years. This is just the next contribution in that history.''"
NYT,Veterans Have Become Unlikely Lobbyists in Push to Legalize Psychedelic Drugs,11-Nov-21,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/11/health/veterans-psychedelics-ptsd-depression.html?searchResultPosition=6,"APPLE VALLEY, Calif. — Jose Martinez, a former Army gunner whose right arm and both legs were blown off by a roadside bomb in Afghanistan, has a new calling: He’s become one of the most effective lobbyists in a campaign to legalize the therapeutic use of psychedelic drugs across the country.

On a Zoom call this spring with Connie Leyva, a Democratic legislator in California who has long opposed relaxing drug laws, Mr. Martinez told her how psilocybin, the psychoactive ingredient in “magic” mushrooms, had helped to finally quell the physical pain and suicidal thoughts that had tormented him.

Ms. Leyva says she changed her mind even before the call ended, and she latervoted yes on the bill, which is expected to become law early next year.

“We ask these men and women to go fight for our freedoms,” she said in an interview. “So if this is something that is helping them live a more normal life, I feel like I shouldn’t stand in the way.”

In the two years since Oregon, Washington, D.C., and a half-dozen municipalities decriminalized psilocybin, vets have become leading advocates in the drive to legalize psychedelic medicine, which they credit with helping ease the post-traumatic stress, anxiety and depression that are often tied to their experiences in the military.

The campaign has been propelled by the epidemic of suicides among veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan, but also by the national reckoning over the mass incarceration of people on drug charges that has softened public attitudes on prohibition.

More than 30,000 service members have taken their own lives in the years since Sept. 11 —four times the number of those who died on the battlefield — and the Department of Veterans Affairs has struggled to address the crisis with the traditional repertoire of pharmacological interventions.

The recent U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan may have marked the end of America’s “forever war,” but the psychological fallout from two decades of military conflict continues to reverberate among many of the 1.9 million personnel who served overseas.

“I will not be told no on something that prevents human beings from killing themselves,” Mr. Martinez said.

Jesse Gould, a former Army Ranger who started Heroic Hearts Project, an organization that connects veterans to psychedelic therapies available in Latin America, also measures the desperation in the daily barrage of emails he gets from vets seeking help.

The waiting list for a treatment slot, he said, has stretched to 850 people.

“The federal health care system has failed us, which is why veterans have to seek care outside the country,” he said. “They are already turning to psychedelic options in droves so we can either decide to call these veterans criminals, which is what we do now, or we can make sure they can get effective care here at home.”

Recent studies have buttressed anecdotal accounts of benefit and helped to quantify the therapeutic value of substances like LSD, psilocybin and MDMA, the drug better known as Ecstasy. A study in Nature Medicine found that MDMA paired with counseling brought marked relief to patients with severe PTSD. Another in the New England Journal of Medicine highlighted the potential of psilocybin therapy for treating severe depression.

Although current federal law largely prohibits the medical use of these compounds, researchers expect MDMA-assisted talk therapy to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration in the next year or two, followed soon after by psilocybin, which has already received agency approval as a “breakthrough therapy” for severe depression. In 2019, the F.D.A. gave approval to esketamine, a nasal spray derived from the anesthetic ketamine, for treatment-resistant depression. Off-label use of ketamine for depression has also become increasingly popular.

Kevin Matthews, a military veteran who led a 2019 ballot measure in Denver that decriminalized psilocybin mushrooms — the first U.S. city to do so — said personal testimonies about psychedelic therapy have been pivotal in winning over skeptics who worry that decriminalization will fuel increased recreational use.

“The key to doing that is getting the right people in front of the right constituencies,” he said.

Decriminalization advocates have made remarkable progress over the past two years. Last month Seattle embraced the decriminalizationof psilocybin and other plant-based psychoactive drugs, and Michigan and several other cities across the country are poised to do the same.

State Senator Scott Wiener, a San Francisco Democrat who sponsored California’s psilocybin measure, said he had been surprised by how readily some opponents changed their minds. “Veterans are very, very compelling messengers,” he said.

But as psychedelics have gained acceptance among mental health professionals, even enthusiastic supporters of decriminalization acknowledge the potential perils of doing so without adequate regulation or professional guidance. Overdoses are rare, and the compounds are not considered addictive, but experts stress the importance of chaperoned drug trips given anecdotal reports about adverse reactions among people with serious disorders like schizophrenia.

At first glance, former military personnel might seem unlikely champions for illegal, mind-altering drugs that many Americans associate with the countercultural peaceniks of the 1960s and 1970s. But veterans have become powerful emissaries for psychedelics across the political spectrum.

Juliana Mercer, a Marine Corps veteran from San Diego who helps connect former service members to psychedelic therapies, says her lobbying efforts are especially useful with Republican legislators who often harbor antidrug attitudes but hold veterans in high esteem.

“It helps that I’m not some stereotypical hippie doing LSD for fun,” she said. “But I think our voices are impactful because we’ve put our lives on the line for our country, and after 20 years of war, we need help healing because nothing has worked so far.”

Recent converts include Rick Perry, the former Republican governor of Texas, who earlier this year returned to the State Capitol to join Democratic lawmakers promoting a bill to authorize the clinical study of psilocybin. The bill passed both legislative chambers in June, and became law.

Mr. Perry declined an interview request, but during a news conference in April he said his conversion from an antidrug stalwart to a champion of psychedelic therapies was inspired by his personal relationship with a combat veteran who had turned to opioids to deal with his PTSD.

United States Representative Dan Crenshaw, a Texas Republican and former Navy SEAL who had consistently opposed efforts to relax drug laws in Congress, also had a change of heart after hearing from fellow veterans. In September, he introduced an amendment to a defense spending bill that would have allowed the Pentagon to fund psychedelics research. The amendment, however, failed to advance out of a House rules committee.

The legalization campaign’s focus on vets as leading advocates is not without controversy. Carlos Plazola, co-founder of the advocacy group Decriminalize Nature, said he was disappointed by the movement’s overemphasis on the struggles of service members. He said a broader cross section of people of color should have their experiences heard.

“We understand the value of pushing patriotism and advancing the American flag to the front of the parade, if you will, but if we’re going to be successful we have to also talk about the traumas of Black, brown and Asian people and Indigenous communities,” he said.

Still, military veterans have proved effective messengers. Mr. Gould, the former Army Ranger, started Heroic Hearts in 2019, not long after he took his first psychedelic journey in Peru with ayahuasca, a plant-derived, hallucinogenic brew that has shown extraordinary promise in treating a range of psychological maladies.

Mr. Gould said a traumatic brain injury caused by the many rocket launches he oversaw during three deployments in Afghanistan left him with uncontrolled spasms of anger and anxiety. Healthy romantic relationships, he said, were out of the question.

“It defragged my brain in a way that allowed it to heal,” he said of the ayahuasca retreat, adding that his new frame of mind made it possible for him to meet the woman who would later become his wife. “It definitely saved my life.”

Researchers are still trying to understand the mechanics of psychedelic-assisted therapies but they are widely thought to promote physiological changes in the brain, sometimes after just one session. On a psychological level, the drugs can provide a fresh perspective on seemingly intractable trauma, giving patients new tools to process pain and find inner peace.

Mr. Martinez, the former Army gunner injured in Afghanistan, has become an especially effective evangelist for psychedelics. He endured 19 surgeries and ceaseless pain that left him dependent on opioids. Beneath the physical agony was an unaddressed wound: childhood abuse he suffered at the hands of a relative.

“For a very long time I didn’t understand why I was so mad at the world,” said Mr. Martinez, 33, who grew up in South Los Angeles and lives with his wife at the edge of the Mojave Desert. Psilocybin, he said, changed everything. Although he still grapples with constant pain, his “journeys” while using the drug allow him to step outside himself and focus on the good, and what is possible in life, which lately includes sidelines as a Paralympic surfer, an archer and a weight-training enthusiast. He also runs a nonprofit that seeks to connect veterans to nature through wilderness outings.

“Psychedelics helped me realize that my problems are small compared to the world’s bigger problems like starvation and cancer,” he said. “And now I understand what I’m actually here for in this world, which is to make people smile and to remind them that life can be beautiful even when it’s not so easy.”"
NYT,The Psychedelic Revolution Is Coming. Psychiatry May Never Be the Same.,09-May-21,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/09/health/psychedelics-mdma-psilocybin-molly-mental-health.html?searchResultPosition=7,"It’s been a long, strange trip in the four decades since Rick Doblin, a pioneering psychedelics researcher, dropped his first hit of acid in college and decided to dedicate his life to the healing powers of mind-altering compounds. Even as antidrug campaigns led to the criminalization of Ecstasy, LSD and magic mushrooms, and drove most researchers from the field, Dr. Doblin continued his quixotic crusade with financial help from his parents.

Dr. Doblin’s quest to win mainstream acceptance of psychedelics took a significant leap forward on Monday when the journal Nature Medicine published the results of his lab’s study on MDMA, the club drug popularly known as Ecstasy and Molly. The study, the first Phase 3 clinical trial conducted with psychedelic-assisted therapy, found that MDMA paired with counseling brought marked relief to patients with severe post-traumatic stress disorder.

The results, coming weeks after a New England Journal of Medicine study that highlighted the benefits of treating depression with psilocybin, the psychoactive ingredient in magic mushrooms, have excited scientists, psychotherapists and entrepreneurs in the rapidly expanding field of psychedelic medicine. They say it is only a matter of time before the Food and Drug Administration grants approval for psychoactive compounds to be used therapeutically — for MDMA as soon as 2023, followed by psilocybin a year or two later.

After decades of demonization and criminalization, psychedelic drugs are on the cusp of entering mainstream psychiatry, with profound implications for a field that in recent decades has seen few pharmacological advancements for the treatment of mental disorders and addiction. The need for new therapeutics has gained greater urgency amid a national epidemic of opioid abuse and suicides.

“Some days I wake up and can’t believe how far we’ve come,” said Dr. Doblin, 67, who now oversees the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, a multimillion dollar research and advocacy empire that employs 130 neuroscientists, pharmacologists and regulatory specialists working to lay the groundwork for the coming psychedelics revolution.

The nation’s top universities are racing to set up psychedelic research centers, and investors are pouring millions of dollars into a pack of start-ups. States and cities across the country are beginning to loosen restrictions on the drugs, the first steps in what some hope will lead to the federal decriminalization of psychedelics for therapeutic and even recreational use.

“There’s been a sea change in attitudes about what not long ago was considered fringe science,” said Michael Pollan, whose best-selling book on psychedelics, “How to Change Your Mind,” has helped destigmatize the drugs in the three years since it was published. “Given the mental health crisis in this country, there’s great curiosity and hope about psychedelics and a recognition that we need new therapeutic tools.”

The question for many is how far — and how fast — the pendulum should swing. Even researchers who champion psychedelic-assisted therapy say the drive to commercialize the drugs, combined with a growing movement to liberalize existing prohibitions, could prove risky, especially for those with severe psychiatric disorders, and derail the field’s slow, methodical return to mainstream acceptance.

Dr. Doblin’s organization, MAPS, is largely focused on winning approval for drug-assisted therapies and promoting them around the globe, but it is also pushing for the legalization of psychedelics at the federal level, though with strict licensing requirements for adult recreational use.

Numerous studies have shown that classic psychedelics like LSD and psilocybin are not addictive and cause no organ damage in even high doses. And contrary to popular lore, Ecstasy does not leave holes in users’ brains, studies say, nor will a bad acid trip lead to chromosome damage.

But most scientists agree that more research is needed on other possible side effects — like how the drugs might affect those with cardiac problems. And while the steady accumulation of encouraging data has softened the skepticism of prominent scientists, some researchers warn against the headlong embrace of psychedelics without stringent oversight. Although “bad trips” are rare, a handful of anecdotal reports suggest that psychedelics can induce psychosis in those with underlying mental disorders.

Dr. Michael P. Bogenschutz, a professor of psychiatry who runs the four-month-old Center for Psychedelic Medicine at NYU Langone Health, said most of the clinical studies to date had been conducted with relatively small numbers of people who were carefully vetted to screen out those with schizophrenia and other serious mental problems.

That makes it hard to know whether there will be potential adverse reactions if the drugs are taken by millions of people without any guidance or supervision. “I know it sounds silly but, Kids, don’t take these at home,” Dr. Bogenschutz said. “I would just encourage everyone to not get ahead of the data.”

The Rush to Invest

Psychedelics are suddenly awash in money.

Dr. Doblin can remember when research funding was nearly impossible to come by. But MAPS is flush now, having raised $44 million over the past two years.

“I spend a lot of my time saying no to investors,” said Dr. Doblin, whose work has been funded by an unlikely collection of philanthropists, among them Rebekah Mercer, the Republican political donor, and David Bronner, a liberal heir to the liquid soap company Dr. Bronners.

Johns Hopkins, Yale, the University of California, Berkeley, and Mount Sinai Hospital in New York are among the institutions that have recently established psychedelic research divisions or are planning to do so, with financing from private donors.

And scientists are conducting studies on whether psychedelics can be effective in treating everything from depression, autism and opioid addiction to anorexia and the anxieties experienced by the terminally ill.

More than a dozen start-ups have jumped into the fray, and the handful of companies that have gone public are collectively valued at more than $2 billion. Field Trip Health, a two-year-old Canadian company that trades on the Canadian Stock Exchange and the OTC Markets Group, has raised $150 million to finance dozens of high-end ketamine clinics in Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston and other cities across North America. Compass Pathways, a Nasdaq-listed health care company that has raised $240 million, is conducting 22 clinical trials across 10 countries of psilocybin therapy for treatment-resistant depression.

Investors have been encouraged by the changing politics, a shift inspired in part by the nation’s accelerating embrace of recreational marijuana and by public weariness over America’s endless war on drugs. Last year, Oregon became the first state to legalize the therapeutic use of psilocybin. Denver, Oakland, Calif., and Washington, D.C., have decriminalized the drug, and several states, including California, are mulling similar legislation. Though the drugs remain illegal under federal law, the Justice Department has so far taken a hands-off approach to enforcement, similar to how it has handled recreational marijuana.

Even some Republicans, a group that has traditionally opposed the liberalization of drug laws, are starting to come around. Last month, the former Texas governor Rick Perry, citing the high rates of suicide among war veterans, called on his state’s legislators to support a Democratic-sponsored bill that would establish a psilocybin study for patients with PTSD.

“We’ve had 50 years of government propaganda around these substances, and thanks to the research and a grass-roots movement, that narrative is changing,” said Kevin Matthews, a psilocybin advocate who led Denver’s successful ballot measure.

Decades in the Wilderness

Long before Nancy Reagan warned the nation to just say no to drugs and President Richard Nixon supposedly pronounced Timothy Leary “the most dangerous man in America,” researchers like William A. Richards were using psychedelics to help alcoholics go dry and cancer patients cope with end-of-life anxiety.

The drugs were legal, and Dr. Richards, then a psychologist at the Maryland Psychiatric Research Center, was among scores of scientists studying the therapeutic prowess of entheogens, the class of psychoactive substances that humans have used for millenniums. Even years later, Dr. Richards and other researchers say, many early volunteers called the psychedelic sessions the most important and meaningful experiences of their lives.

But as the drugs left the lab in the 1960s and were embraced by the counterculture movement, the country’s political establishment reacted with alarm. By the time the Drug Enforcement Administration issued its emergency ban on MDMA in 1985, funding for psychedelic research had largely disappeared.

“We were learning so much, and then it all came to an end,” said Dr. Richards, 80, and now a researcher at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

These days, the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research at Johns Hopkins, created two years ago with $17 million in private funding, is studying, among other things, psilocybin for smoking cessation and the treatment of depression associated with Alzheimer’s as well as more spiritual explorations involving religious clergy.

“We have to be careful not to overpromise, but these are fantastically interesting compounds with numerous possible uses,” said Roland R. Griffiths, the center’s founding director and a psychopharmacologist whose 2006 study, on which he is a co-author with Dr. Richards, administered psilocybin to healthy volunteers — one of the first psychedelic studies to win F.D.A. approval in a generation.

Though researchers are still trying to understand the cognitive and therapeutic mechanics of psychedelics, they have concluded that psilocybin, DMT and other psychoactive chemicals can help people feel more tolerance, understanding and empathy. They also induce neuroplasticity, the brain’s ability to change and reorganize thought patterns, enabling people with psychological disorders to find new ways to process anxiety, depression or deeply embedded trauma.

“They can help people who have lost the plotline of their lives,” Dr. Doblin said.

The Trip Business

The future of psychedelic medicine can already be glimpsed at a suite of plush, soothingly decorated “journey rooms” that occupy the top floor of an office building in Midtown Manhattan. The clinic, run by Field Trip Health, is a year-old venture where patients wear eyeshades and listen to electronic music and Tibetan chanting, as they are administered six ketamine injections over the course of several weeks.

The 90-minute trips are interspersed with therapist-guided “integration sessions” to help participants process their experiences and work on achieving their mental health goals. A typical course of four sessions starts at $4,100, though some insurance companies reimburse patients for a portion of the cost.

Ketamine is not a classic psychedelic; it is an anesthetic perhaps best known as both a club drug and a horse tranquilizer. But at higher doses, it can produce hallucinations, and it has shown promise treating major depression and severe PTSD, though the effects tend to be less enduring than therapies with psilocybin or MDMA. Ketamine, however, has a distinct advantage over those other drugs: It is the only one in the United States that is legally available to patients outside a clinical study.

Emily Hackenburg, Field Trip’s clinical director, said the drug was only one component of a demanding therapeutic process. “The drug is not a magic bullet,” she said.

Joe, a marketing executive in his mid-40s who has battled depression and anxiety for decades, said he decided to visit the company’s Atlanta location after seeing one of its ads on Facebook. Antidepressants, he said, left him emotionally brittle, and his years of psychotherapy were of little use. (He asked that his full name be withheld, citing the stigmas surrounding both mental illness and mind-altering drugs.)

In an interview one week after his final session, he described a newfound awareness of the factors that could drive him to despair: his “alpha male” obsession with success, the frustrations stoked by his 9-year-old daughter’s misbehavior and the poor eating and drinking habits that often leave him feeling unwell.

In a follow-up conversation two weeks later, Joe said the therapy’s effects were beginning to fade. He said that he was eager to try psilocybin-assisted therapy. “I’m really looking forward to the day when that becomes legal,” he said.

So, too, is Field Trip. The company, which got its start opening cannabis clinics across Canada, is planning to test psilocybin therapy next month in Amsterdam, where magic mushroom truffles are legal. And its scientists are currently developing a new psychedelic that carries the therapeutic punch of psilocybin but works in about half the time — about two to three hours. Creating a proprietary short-lived psychedelic would reduce the staffing costs of supervised sessions, but more important, it would give the company lucrative exclusivity over its new drug. Other biotech companies are also developing new psychedelic compounds.

Ronan Levy, Field Trip&#39;s executive chairman, said the company was hoping to grab a slice of the $240 billion that Americans spend each year on mental health services. “We are riding the forefront of what I think is going to be a significant cultural and business wave,” he said.

To veteran scientists who lived through the nation’s earlier star-crossed love affair with psychedelics, such corporate boosterism is both thrilling and troubling. They are mindful about potential missteps that could undo the progress of recent years, and they question whether the coming commercialization could limit access to those with limited financial means.

Dr. Charles S. Grob, a professor of psychiatry at U.C.L.A.’s school of medicine who has spent decades researching hallucinogens, worries that commercialization and a rush toward recreational use could prompt a public backlash, especially if increased availability of the drugs leads to a wave of troubling psychotic reactions.

What is needed, he said, are rigorous protocols and a system to train and credential psychedelic medicine professionals. “We have to be very attentive to safety parameters, because if conditions are not properly maintained, there is a risk for some people to go off the rails psychologically,” he said. “And if the primary motivator is extracting profit, I feel the field is more vulnerable to mishaps.”

Dr. Doblin shares some of those concerns, even if his institute stands to profit handsomely. Although MAPS is a nonprofit, it has recently created a corporate entity and hired management consultants to help plot the future of legalized MDMA therapy.

Winning F.D.A. approval would give MAPS at least six years of exclusivity to market its MDMA-guided treatments for PTSD, with a potential windfall of $750 million. Most of that money, he said, would help train a generation of psychedelic practitioners, fund lobbying efforts to require insurance coverage for such treatments and promote new therapies around the world. “Our goal is mass mental health,” he said, explaining the organization’s rejection of private investment. “It’s not to amass a whole bunch of money.”

Despite his optimism, Dr. Doblin is not blind to the possibility that society’s fascination with psychedelics could sour. “We’ve made so much progress so fast but there are so many challenges ahead,” he said. “I realize,” he said, “we could screw things up at the last minute so I’m not planning to celebrate any time soon.”"
NYT,Johns Hopkins Opens New Center for Psychedelic Research,04-Sept-19,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/science/psychedelic-drugs-hopkins-depression.html?searchResultPosition=8,"The research center, with $17 million from donors, aims to give “psychedelic medicine” a long-sought foothold in the scientific establishment.

Since childhood, Rachael Petersen had lived with an unexplainable sense of grief that no drug or talk therapy could entirely ease. So in 2017 she volunteered for a small clinical trial at Johns Hopkins University that was testing psilocybin, the active ingredient in magic mushrooms, for chronic depression.

“I was so depressed,” Ms. Petersen, 29, said recently. “I felt that the world had abandoned me, that I’d lost the right to exist on this planet. Really, it was like my thoughts were so stuck, I felt isolated.”

The prospect of tripping for hours on a heavy dose of psychedelics was scary, she said, but the reality was profoundly different: “I experienced this kind of unity, of resonant love, the sense that I’m not alone anymore, that there was this thing holding me that was bigger than my grief. I felt welcomed back to the world.”

On Wednesday, Johns Hopkins Medicine announced the launch of the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research, to study compounds like LSD and psilocybin for a range of mental health problems, including anorexia, addiction and depression. The center is the first of its kind in the country, established with $17 million in commitments from wealthy private donors and a foundation. Imperial College London launched what is thought to be the world’s first such center in April, with some $3.5 million from private sources.

“This is an exciting initiative that brings new focus to efforts to learn about mind, brain and psychiatric disorders by studying the effects of psychedelic drugs,” Dr. John Krystal, chair of psychiatry at Yale University, said in an email about the Johns Hopkins center.

The centers at Johns Hopkins and Imperial College give “psychedelic medicine,” as some call it, a long-sought foothold in the scientific establishment. Since the early 2000s, several scientists have been exploring the potential of psychedelics and other recreational drugs for psychiatric problems, and their early reports have been tantalizing enough to generate a stream of positive headlines and at least two popular books. The emergence of depression treatment with the anesthetic and club drug ketamine and related compounds, which cause out-of-body sensations, also has piqued interest in mind-altering agents as aids to therapy.

But the drugs’ history of abuse and the still thin evidence base have kept the field largely on the fringes, and many experts are still wary. Psychedelic trials cannot be “blinded” in the same way most drug trials are: participants know when they have been dosed, and reports of improvement aren’t yet standardized.

“It raises the caution that the investigation of hallucinogens as treatments may be endangered by grandiose descriptions of their effects and unquestioning acceptance of their value,” Dr. Guy Goodwin, a professor of psychiatry at Oxford wrote,in a recent   commentary   , in the Journal of Psychopharmacology. “Timothy Leary was a research psychologist before he decided the whole world should ‘Turn on, tune in, and drop out.’ It is best if some steps are not retraced.”

The scientists doing the work, at Hopkins, Imperial College and elsewhere, acknowledge as much, and say the new infusion of funding will help clarify which drugs help which patients, and when the altered states are ineffectual, or potentially dangerous.

“It’s been hand-to-mouth in this field, and now we have the core funding and infrastructure to really advance psychedelic science in a way that hasn’t been done before,” said Roland Griffiths, a neuroscientist at Johns Hopkins who will direct the new center. Dr. Griffiths said the new funds will cover six full-time faculty, five postdoctoral scientists and the costs of running trials. Among the first of those trials are a test of psilocybin for anorexia nervosa and of psilocybin for psychological distress and cognitive impairment in early Alzheimer’s disease.

“The one that’s crying out to be done is for opiate-use disorder, and we also plan to look at that,” Dr. Griffiths said.

Trials using psychedelics or other mind-altering drugs tend to have a similar structure. Participants, whether they have a diagnosis of PTSD, depression or substance abuse, do extensive preparation with a therapist, which includes a complete medical history and advice and information about the study drug. People with a history of psychosis are typically excluded, as psychedelics can exacerbate their condition. And those on psychiatric medications usually taper off beforehand.

On treatment day, the person comes into the clinic, takes the drug and sits or lies down, under continuous observation by a therapist, who provides support and occasional guidance as the drug’s effects become felt. In the Johns Hopkins trial that Ms. Petersen joined, participants wore eyeshades and headphones, lay down and listened to music.

“The first trip lasted six and half hours, and I didn’t move,” she recalled. A week later, she returned for another dose; each dose was about twice what recreational users take. Therapy using psychedelics or other mind-altering compounds typically involves just one or two sessions on the drug.

“I would be lying if I said aspects of my experience weren’t deeply challenging and upsetting,” Ms. Petersen said. “The therapist would grab my hand — would save me in a moment — and encourage me to adopt a posture of welcoming everything, like a meditation.”

The literature so far, from trials like these, suggests that psilocybin is promising for chronic depression and addiction, and that M.D.M.A., or ecstasy, can help people with post-traumatic stress, including veterans. Cannabis and LSD also have been tried, for addiction and other problems, with mixed results.

One finding many drug studies share is that any positive effects are far more likely to last if the participant has an especially intense trip. The intensity is subjectively graded using a variety of measures, including what scientists call the MEQ, for “mystical experience, questionnaire,” although Dr. Griffiths allowed that the term is misleading.

“That was a significant branding mistake, because awe is not fun,” he said. “There’s something existentially shaking about these experiences.”

It is that existential reckoning, the theory goes, that prompts many people to rejigger their identities or priorities in a way that reduces habitual behaviors or lines of thinking that cause distress.

In a continuing trial, Matthew Johnson, an addiction specialist at Johns Hopkins and a member of the new psychedelic center, is investigating how psilocybin treatment compares to use of a nicotine patch in helping people to quit smoking. So far, in the 39 people who have been in the study for at least six months, the abstinence rate in the psilocybin group is 50 percent, compared to 32 percent using the patch.

“The most compelling thing that makes psilocybin different from other addiction drugs is that it’s showing this cross-drug efficacy,” Dr. Johnson said. “It appears to have a similar effect, regardless of what drug the person is addicted to.”

That great potential, across many different diagnoses, is what attracted a small group of donors to Johns Hopkins, said Tim Ferriss, who brought in half the donated amount from investors, including more than $2 million from himself. Mr. Ferriss, an investor and author, said that depression and addiction ran in his own family, and that available treatments were often inadequate. His investment in the center, he said, “was a chance to have a large output from a small input — a real Archimedes lever.” The Steven &amp; Alexandra Cohen Foundation provided the balance of the commitments.

Ms. Petersen is convinced that her psilocybin trip made a lasting difference. She has had one relapse since the trial, she said, and continued on antidepressant drugs. As a result of the trial, she also reordered her life, committing more time to things that are emotionally sustaining, and letting go of those there weren’t.

“I think that trial was the single most effective thing I’ve done to manage my mental health, and I had tried almost everything,” she said. “And it leads me to believe that we need to radically change how we think about mental health.”"
NYT,Denver Votes on Whether to Decriminalize ‘Magic Mushrooms’,07-May-19,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/05/07/us/denver-magic-mushrooms.html?searchResultPosition=9,"Voters in Denver, a city at the forefront of the widening national debate over legalizing marijuana, will decide on Tuesday whether to be the first in the nation to effectively decriminalize another recreational drug: hallucinogenic mushrooms.

The local ballot measure would not quite legalize “magic” mushrooms, the ones that contain psilocybin, a naturally occurring psychedelic compound. State and federal regulations would have to change to accomplish that.

But if it passes, the measure would make the possession, use or cultivation of the mushrooms by people aged 21 or older the lowest-priority crime for law enforcement in the city of Denver and Denver County. Arrests and prosecutions, already fairly rare, could all but disappear.

Adoption of the measure could signal fledgling public acceptance of a mind-altering drug, outlawed nationally for nearly 50 years, that recent research suggests could have beneficial medical uses. A similar effort failed to get on the ballot in California last year, but it could come up again in 2020; Oregon voters may also vote on a comparable measure next year.

Proponents of more lenient criminal enforcement of psilocybin cite studies indicating that the drug can be beneficial for treating depression and anxiety among cancer patients. Other studies have identified potential uses in therapy for alcoholics and people trying to quit smoking, and in treating depression in people who do not have cancer.

“Because psilocybin has such tremendous medical potential, there’s no reason individuals should be criminalized for using something that grows naturally,” said Kevin Matthews, the director of the “Decriminalize Denver” campaign.

Mr. Matthews, 33, credits psilocybin mushrooms with helping pull him out of a major depression that forced him to withdraw from the United States Military Academy at West Point, where he was a cadet for three years in his 20s.

“It really helped me see outside the box of my own life,” Mr. Matthews said of the drug. “It brought me out of the depths of my own internal struggles and despair.”

Dr. Matthew Johnson, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, was one of the authors of a study last year recommending that the Food and Drug Administration reclassify the drug to acknowledge its potential medical uses and relatively low potential for abuse.

Psilocybin is not addictive, and “there’s no direct lethal overdose” of the drug on record, Dr. Johnson said.

“But someone can have a dose that’s psychologically challenging,” he warned. “They panic and they wander into traffic and they die. It’s an admittedly low scale, but if that’s your son or daughter who has gotten into a fatal accident, as rare as that it is, that’s very real.”

Researchers who study psilocybin’s effects use a synthetic version of the drug in carefully controlled environments, he said, which is different from someone growing mushrooms and ingesting them at home.

“Decriminalization in general is supported by public health science,” Dr. Johnson said about Denver’s psilocybin ballot measure. “But if this happens, I would hope that the city would be very clear that it’s not endorsing use, and that there are very clear risks.”

The ballot measure, Initiated Ordinance 301, would also establish a panel to review the law’s impact on public health and safety. The polls are scheduled to close at 7 p.m. Mountain time.

Art Way, the Colorado state director for a pro-legalization advocacy group, the Drug Policy Alliance, praised the local effort in Denver to move psilocybin enforcement off the police’s radar. But he cautioned against tackling the issue piecemeal.

“Separating some drugs as good and some as bad will only stand to perpetuate the drug war,” he said.

Arrests in Denver for incidents involving psilocybin have not numbered more than 59 in any of the last three years, and only 11 cases were prosecuted in that time.

Beth McCann, the district attorney in Denver, opposes the ballot measure, according to a spokeswoman, Carolyn A. Tyler.

“We’re still in the very early stages of marijuana legalization, and we are still learning the impact of that substance on our city,” Ms. Tyler said. “And she is not in favor of Denver being the only city that doesn’t enforce the law.”

Mayor Michael Hancock, who is up for re-election in the municipal election on Tuesday, is also against the proposal, his office said, without elaborating on his reasoning. The Denver Police Department declined to take a position.

Mr. Matthews, the leader of the decriminalization campaign, said the initiative had not met with any organized public opposition. His group collected the necessary signatures to get the proposal on Tuesday’s ballot and raised about $45,000, mostly for social media advertising. No polling has been conducted on the measure.

Jeff Hunt, the director of the Centennial Institute, a policy research group at Colorado Christian University, said he thought the measure could pass, since no one systematically campaigned against it — but people might also be wary of deregulating too many drugs at the same time.

He noted that decriminalization was the first step toward legalizing marijuana, and said that proponents of the psilocybin measure, which he opposes, might be trying to travel the same road.

“What we’re seeing is a kind of social libertarianism that is reacting against the war on drugs, and that’s led us to a position where people feel like drugs like marijuana and even psilocybin could be harmless,” Mr. Hunt said. “And that’s deeply harmful.”"

The “No” vote had led throughout the day, until the last updated count by elections officials. Alton P.

“We won!!!!” the group called Decriminalize Denver that had been pushing the measure, said in a jubilant post on Facebook.

NYT,The Promises and Perils of Psychedelic Health Care,25-Jan-22,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/05/well/psychedelic-drugs-mental-health-therapy.html?searchResultPosition=12,"Many recreational drugs known for mind-altering trips are being studied to treat depression, substance use and other disorders. Here’s what you need to know.

Oregon is legalizing mushrooms. Ketamine can be delivered to your home. People are microdosing LSD to treat pandemic-related anxiety and Wall Street is pouring billions into companies that sell mind-altering drugs. It seems like psychedelics — though mostly still illegal — are everywhere.

While the federal government does not recognize a medical use for most of these drugs and says they have potential for abuse, some of the most prominent universities in the world are studying four substances in particular: psilocybin, ketamine, MDMA and LSD. The bulk of available research suggests that these substances hold promise as part of larger treatment plans.

There is also growing evidence that psychedelic drugs operate differently in the brain than addictive drugs, and advocates have been consistently calling for legalization. But psychedelics remain expensive and difficult to gain access to legally, unless you are part of a research study for mental health purposes.

These drugs are not all the same and do come with risks. One quality they share is the ability to create an altered state of consciousness, commonly referred to as a trip. That effect can either provide a sense of perspective — or be downright terrifying.

“You’re not likely to overdose on them, but you can have life-changing negative experiences,” Katharine Neill Harris, a drug policy researcher at Rice University in Texas, said.

To avoid these experiences, while receiving the benefits these drugs can offer, people have started microdosing smaller amounts at regular intervals — but they are often doing so without professional guidance, and some remain uninformed about significant downsides with very little evidence of benefits.

Here’s what researchers are learning about the psychedelic drugs most prominently involved in mental health research.

Psilocybin

As the active chemical in magic mushrooms, or ’shrooms, psilocybin is the most studied of the psychedelic chemicals found in plants and fungi, and it’s the most likely to become an accepted mental health therapy soon. After last year’s legalization in Oregon, entrepreneurs began investing tens of millions in psilocybin research there, and other cities and states are following suit.

Potential mental health uses: Research conducted in the last decade suggests that psilocybin, typically taken in pill form, has the potential to treat substance use disorders, including alcoholism and nicotine addiction, as well as depression.

That research isn’t conclusive yet, said Paul Hutson, a professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison who studies psilocybin and leads the school’s center for psychedelics research. But he anticipates there will soon be enough evidence for the Food and Drug Administration to approve psilocybin capsules to treat at least some of these disorders — most likely in the next five years or so.

In the meantime, clinical trials of psilocybin for a variety of conditions are taking place across the country, though they can be difficult to find or have long waiting lists. Still, it’s safer, Dr. Hutson said, to try psilocybin as part of a study than on your own or in one of the treatment clinics that have popped up. In these trials, patients attend appointments to prepare for and process their psychedelic trip with a professional in an environment where any side effects can be managed.

What it does: According to users who have participated in trials, a mushroom trip may induce euphoria and an increased awareness of parts of their environment. For instance, solid objects might seem to breathe in and out. A trip can last more than six hours, and some people describe a positive “afterglow” lasting for months.

Risks: Psilocybin can cause distressing hallucinations or feelings of panic and anxiety in some patients, especially at high doses. You can’t be guaranteed safety standards — having a trained professional who can reassure you, protect you and even administer drugs during a bad trip — in therapy outside of a research trial, Dr. Harris said.

One use of psilocybin, which should not be confused with standard treatment described above, is microdosing. By taking small doses — perhaps 10 percentof a standard dose — every few days, some people might experience mental health benefits without the high. But microdosing psilocybin can be harmful, and there is some evidence that it can damage the heart over time. Recent research also suggests that the positive impacts of microdosing in humans may be largely caused by the placebo effect.

Ketamine

First synthesized in 1956, ketamine, sometimes called Special K, is used today as an anesthetic by veterinarians and in emergency or combat medicine. Because it is the one psychedelic that’s never been illegal, researchers have been able to explore ketamine’s potential as a mental health treatment — and build a case for its use in humans.

Potential mental health uses: Many brain disorders — like schizophrenia, depression and anxiety — are characterized by atrophy in the prefrontal cortex. The evidence is strong, though not yet conclusive, that ketamine helps people with psychiatric disorders by promoting regrowth over time in neurons in this area. That could help explain the near-immediate feelings of relief that users report, which is one of the reasons it has been used in the treatment of suicidal patients.

Esketamine, a form of ketamine, showed such promise for treating major depression, often faster than other drugs, that the F.D.A. approved its limited use in early 2019.

What it does: Ketamine can create euphoria and provide a sense of detachment from reality. Users taking a low dose might feel as though they’re floating or that their body is numb. Higher doses can temporarily make people clumsy and forget where they are or even who they are. Blurred vision or hallucinations are common.

Ketamine works differently from other psychedelics. Most psychedelics — like LSD, MDMA and those derived from plants — operate by affecting serotonin receptors, which alter mood and happiness. Ketamine affects a different class of brain receptors that are important for learning and memory. Both kinds of receptors are found in the brain’s prefrontal cortex, which might explain why ketamine and the other psychedelics seem to have similar impacts on mental health.

“The prefrontal cortex is a brain region that’s really critical,” said David Olson, a chemistry professor at University of California, Davis, who studies chemicals that affect brain function. “It talks to a whole bunch of brain regions that regulate things like mood, emotion, fear, reward.”

Risks: Ketamine is also known for a specific and scary side effect nicknamed the “k-hole.” It’s rare in clinical settings, but users may feel disassociated from themselves and their surroundings and panic or feel paranoid.

LSD

“Turn on, tune in, drop out.” “Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds.” Silicon Valley microdosing. Suffice it to say, LSD, also known as acid, has a storied place in American popular culture.

Potential mental health uses: It’s shown promise for treating alcohol addiction and has been studied for other conditions like depression. As with psilocybin, some new LSD adherents microdose to achieve mental health benefits without the trip.

What it does: LSD users have reported feelings of bliss during their trip, being able to see sound and having mystical experiences as well as a sense of closeness with others.

Risks: Some people experience lasting psychological trauma caused by a bad trip, especially when they take higher doses or use LSD often.

Microdosing LSD may have physical risks, too. In a study on rats, microdosing LSD had the opposite effect of a trip; it made the rats display signs of psychiatric illness, like aggression and poor grooming. Similar to microdosing psilocybin, it may also strain the heart by overworking the neurons around the organ.

“If you’re constantly stimulating these neurons, even with a small dose of these compounds, the neurons just can’t take it,” Dr. Olson said.

MDMA

A well-known club drug, also known as ecstasy or molly, MDMA has been researched on and off for decades for potential mental health benefits. While the drug remains illegal, the F.D.A. allows its use in research and treatment for life-threatening illness.

Potential mental health uses: In 2010, results from a study on treatment-resistant PTSD renewed interest in MDMA research. Since then, it has also been explored as a treatment for other conditions like substance use disorder or social anxiety in autistic adults, although it has more potential to cause damage than some other psychedelics.

What it does: MDMA is often known by its street name — ecstasy — from the feeling of euphoria and connectedness it promotes in users.

Risks: MDMA can cause lasting kidney and organ damage as well as heart arrhythmias during a trip, especially in patients with related pre-existing conditions.

***

Psychedelic drugs aren’t simple substances. More time and research will provide answers about their effects on the brain and whether it’s possible to use them for medical treatments. For now, Dr. Hutson cautioned that evidence supports psychedelic treatments only in cases where other forms of treatment haven’t worked.

“They’re not a panacea that everybody is going to respond to,” he said."
NYT,There Is a Lot of Fungus Among Us,24-Apr-21,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/04/24/business/there-is-a-lot-of-fungus-among-us.html?searchResultPosition=13,"Inside a state-of-the-art lab, tucked in an industrial neighborhood on Vancouver Island in British Columbia, employees wearing protective suits move around two clear boxes, careful not to disrupt the tubes and sensors that keep temperature and humidity constant. Inside the boxes are mushrooms.

But not just any mushrooms. They are psychedelic — “magic” — mushrooms that the start-up Numinus Wellness believes one day may be used to treat mental health conditions as varied as depression, substance abuse and anxiety.

Welcome to the ’Shroom Boom. While Numinus is using mushrooms to make mind-altering therapies, other mushroom growers are promising other benefits, like strengthening immune systems or reducing inflammation. Mushrooms are showing up in all sorts of wellness products, pushing them into the mainstream and making mushrooms a major force in the flourishing, multibillion-dollar wellness market.

It’s hard these days to throw a rock and not hit a mushroom.

A top-selling coffee on Amazon by Four Sigmatic is made with the chaga mushroom, promising immune support and stress relief. Mushroom supplements that claim to support immune systems, reduce inflammation and improve moods can be found in health and wellness stores, but also major retailers like Nordstrom and Urban Outfitters. Om Hot Chocolate says it will help you focus and de-stress. For $96, the Beauty brand Mara sells a vitamin C serum that contains reishi mushrooms that it claims will reduce inflammation.

“As a food, mushrooms have a lot of things going for them in terms of their nutritional value,” said Joshua Lambert, a co-director of the Center for Plant and Mushroom Foods for Health at the Penn State College for Agricultural Sciences. “But one of the things we’re looking into are the other compounds that mushrooms and other plants have that may have significant health benefits.”

The latest frontier for mushrooms could be the most interesting — and the most complicated. Last November, Oregon became the first state to legalize psilocybin, the main active ingredient in “magic” mushrooms, for the treatment of certain mental health conditions in supervised settings. In March, the New York City mayoral candidate Andrew Yang said New York State should legalize psychedelic mushrooms, a stance he raised in 2019 when he was a Democratic presidential candidate.

Regulators in the United States and Canada are taking baby steps toward allowing limited use of psychedelic mushrooms, which produce visual and auditory hallucinations over a few hours after ingestion, for the treatment of certain mental health conditions. Popular as part of the counterculture in the 1960s, magic mushrooms were deemed illegal in the United States in the 1970s.

Investors are taking note. Atai Life Sciences, a German firm developing psychedelic and nonpsychedelic compounds for various mental health conditions, is backed by the billionaire venture capitalist Peter Thiel and others. It filed plans this past week to raise $100 million in a public offering. Another psychedelic company, MindMed, has financial backing from Kevin O’Leary of “Shark Tank.”

In the past year, more than 20 companies focused on psychedelics have gone public, and a dozen more existing public companies have moved into the space, according to analysts at the Vancouver-based investment bank Canaccord Genuity.

“There are currently 100 to 150 clinical trials underway using psychedelic compounds to treat mental and behavioral health conditions,” analysts at Canaccord Genuity wrote in a report in March, adding “the industry has come a long way in the last year, but, there’s still a long way to go.”

Some investors are betting that the psychedelic companies could follow in the footsteps of marijuana, which has been legalized for recreational use in more than a dozen states, including New York in March. But some analysts and many of the companies themselves caution that the path for psychedelics will most likely be very different.

“Psychedelics are about health care, medically approved therapies. It’s not going to go the recreational route that cannabis did,” said Payton Nyquvest, who co-founded Numinus in 2018 and is its chief executive. And while Numinus was the first public company in Canada to harvest the first legal batch of mushrooms from the Psilocybe genus last year, its stock has been stuck trading under one dollar.

Mr. Nyquvest attributed the stock price to the fact that “the sector has only recently come to prominence, and investors are still trying to define how to value companies in the space.”

The current mushroom boom is a surprise to many industry long-timers.

While Europeans and Asians loved the wild mushrooms that Joseph Salvo of Ponderosa Mushrooms harvested all across Canada, he couldn’t drive up any interest among U.S. or Canadian consumers.

Though long loved in Italian pasta dishes, a staple in Japanese soups, and a robust substitution for meat, mushrooms have been a tough sell to U.S. and Canadian consumers. That began to shift about eight years ago when more chefs started using wild mushrooms in cooking shows and such, said Mr. Salvo. Then, Costco began carrying his fresh, in-season chanterelle mushrooms in its stores.

Today, Mr. Salvo grows shiitake, king oyster and other mushrooms in Ponderosa Mushroom’s 28 temperature- and climate-controlled rooms. He also grows shiitake mushrooms outdoors in the logs of alder trees. The mushrooms are shipped to retailers all over the world.

While much of Ponderosa’s mushrooms end up on dinner plates, Mr. Salvo said his mushrooms were also making their way into new, interesting areas, like tea and even beer.

Five hours east of Vancouver in Vernon, B.C., the start-up Doseology Sciences is also focusing on the wellness area. Inside a series of climate-controlled shipping containers that smell of damp, cool soil, Doseology is growing lion’s mane, shiitake and cordyceps mushrooms. A larger facility will be used to grow psychedelic mushrooms when it gets its license to do so, which could happen later this year.

Various mushroom tinctures, serums and powders are finding their way into wellness regimens partly because after decades of relying on pharmaceuticals to control various diseases and conditions, consumers are now increasingly focusing on diet and more natural ways to improve their health, said Dr. Lambert, of Penn State.

Frustration with traditional drugs that did little to address his longtime chronic pain and mental health conditions is what drove Mr. Nyquvest of Numinus to become interested in psychedelic compounds as a treatment.

He points to numerous studies around the benefits of psychedelic mushrooms, including a 2016 study by researchers at Johns Hopkins Medicine that found use of psilocybin relieved anxiety and depression in people with a life-threatening cancer diagnosis. A second, small study involving 24 participants conducted by Johns Hopkins researchers that was published in JAMA Psychiatry found that those who received psilocybin-assisted therapy showed improvement as well.

“The magnitude of the effect we saw was about four times larger than what clinical trials have shown for traditional antidepressants on the market,” Alan Davis, adjunct assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said in an announcement about the study’s results.

The Food and Drug Administration has put at least two psychedelic mushroom compounds on the fast track for approval to treat depression.

Last year, Canada began allowing a limited number of people with terminal illness to use psychedelic mushrooms. Currently, Numinus is working toward a psilocybin-assisted therapy trial for patients with substance abuse disorders.

And while regulators in the United States are taking a new look at psychedelic mushrooms, psilocybin is still a Schedule 1 drug and would need to be reclassified by regulators.

Despite those hurdles, though, Mr. Nyquvest sees the potential for a broader use of psychedelic mushrooms around wellness, beyond what he called “treating really heavy indicators” of substance abuse and depression.

“The same way you go to the dentist to take care of the teeth, we need to think about taking care of the brain and mental well being.”"
NYT,How Should We Do Drugs Now?,09-Jul-21,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/07/09/opinion/sunday/drug-legalization-mdma-psilocybin.html?searchResultPosition=14,"After a half century spent waging war on drugs, Americans seem ready to sue for peace. The 2020 elections brought plenty of proof that voters have leapt ahead of politicians in recognizing both the failures of the drug war and the potential of certain illicit drugs as powerful tools for healing.

Ballot initiatives in five states — four of them traditionally red — legalized some form of cannabis use. By substantial margins, Oregon passed two landmark drug reform initiatives: Fifty-nine percent of voters supported Measure 110, which decriminalized the possession of small quantities of all drugs, even hard ones like heroin and cocaine. A second proposal, Measure 109, specifically legalized psilocybin therapy, directing the state’s health department to license growers of so-called magic mushrooms and train facilitators to administer them beginning in 2023.

In the past two years, a new drug policy reform movement called Decriminalize Nature has persuaded local governments in a half dozen municipalities, including Washington, D.C., to decriminalize “plant medicines” such as psilocybin, ayahuasca, iboga and the cactuses that produce mescaline. Last month, the California State Senate passed a bill that would make legal the personal possession, use and “social sharing” of psychedelics, including LSD and MDMA, a.k.a. Ecstasy or Molly. Political opposition to all these measures has been notably thin. Neither party, it seems, has the stomach for persisting in a war that has achieved so little while doing so much damage, especially to communities of color and our civil liberties.

But while we can now begin to glimpse an end to the drug war, it is much harder to envision what the drug peace will look like. How will we fold these powerful substances into our society and our lives so as to minimize their risks and use them most constructively? The blunt binaries of “Just say no” that have held sway for so long have kept us from having this conversation and from appreciating how different one illicit drug is from another.

That conversation begins with the recognition that humans like to change consciousness and that cultures have been using psychoactive plants and fungi to do so for as long as there have been cultures. Something about us is just not satisfied with ordinary consciousness and seeks to transcend it in various ways, some of them disruptive (as psychedelics were in the West in the 1960s) and others generally accepted as productive, like caffeine. Hence the ritual of the coffee break, in which employers give employees both the drug and paid time off in which to enjoy it.

But context is everything: In many Native American communities, peyote, a psychedelic, is not at all disruptive; to the contrary, its ceremonial use promotes social cohesion and heals trauma. Timothy Leary’s notion of the importance of “set and setting” — that is, expectation and context — probably applies to all drugs, not just psychedelics, something worth keeping in mind as we navigate this new world.

In the case of psychedelics, decriminalizing these powerful compounds is only the first step in a process of figuring out how best to safely weave their use into our society. The main model we have for resocializing a formerly illicit drug is the legalization of cannabis, now the new normal in 18 states, and many in the cannabis world look to psilocybin as the next cannabis. But the prospect of magic mushrooms being commercialized like cannabis — advertised on billboards and sold next to THC gummy bears in dispensaries — should fill us with trepidation. Microdoses perhaps, but a macrodose of psilocybin is a powerful, consequential and risky experience that demands careful preparation and an experienced sitter or guide. We will need to look elsewhere for models of safe and sane psychedelic use.

But where? The straightest and least controversial path to folding psilocybin, as well as MDMA, into society is the medical route, which passes through the Food and Drug Administration drug approval process. These drugs are already well along in that process, and both should be approved for use in psychotherapy within a few years — MDMA to treat post-traumatic stress disorder and psilocybin to treat depression and addiction. After that happens, doctors will be able to prescribe these compounds, though not willy-nilly. The agency is expected to issue regulations stipulating exactly how and by whom they can be administered, probably with a trained facilitator in a safe place, in order to maximize the value of the therapy and minimize the chances of a bad trip.

But what about the rest of us — healthy people without a psychiatric diagnosis who want to use psychedelics for therapy, self-discovery or spiritual development? A small handful of religious organizations have marked out a second path to normalization. Since 1994, the Native American Church, now with an estimated 250,000 members, has had the right to use peyote as a sacrament. Since then, two other churches have secured the right to use ayahuasca. Today, new churches organized around the use of psilocybin, LSD and other so-called entheogens are springing up, with plans to seek legal recognition. Some legal experts expect them to prevail. This Supreme Court’s expansive jurisprudence on religious freedom has created a wide opening through which a parade of new psychedelic churches may be able to march. The same majority that ruled that the religious beliefs of a corporation, Hobby Lobby, exempted it from provisions of federal law may find it impossible to rule against the right of the Church of Lysergic Acid to use its chosen sacrament. Americans could soon be able to go to a church to have a ritualized psychedelic experience.

As for other Americans who want to use psychedelics in a more secular setting, it’s easy to imagine spa-like retreat centers popping up across the country. Indeed, a prototype already exists: Field Trip Health has opened a half dozen lavishly appointed clinics (with more on the way) offering ketamine-assisted therapy for depression, which is already legal, in anticipation of Food and Drug Administration approval of MDMA and psilocybin. A psychiatrist on staff screens “patients” — i.e., customers — and then a doctor or nurse practitioner administers the drug; trained facilitators prepare the clients for what to expect and then sit with them during the experience, afterward helping to “integrate” — make sense of and apply — whatever they have learned.

Different as they sound, the medical, religious and, for lack of a better term, retreat-center uses of psychedelics are all highly formalized, which is important. When psychedelics first burst upon the West in the middle of the last century, they arrived without an instruction manual and so were sometimes used recklessly, without regard for set and setting. People thought nothing of dropping acid at festivals and protests or of spiking punch bowls with LSD, a practice that seems crazy, if not cruel. It’s no wonder the bad trip became such a powerful meme and the culture turned against psychedelics.

In fact, a user’s manual for the safe and constructive use of psychedelics did exist, even then; most of us just weren’t aware of it. I’m thinking of the use of psychedelics by Indigenous peoples, which suggests a model we would do well to keep in mind as we figure out how best to handle these substances. There are numerous examples of Indigenous peoples that have successfully incorporated psychedelic compounds into their cultures as a sacrament, medicine or medium of communication. Surveying these cultures, you find a few common denominators. People seldom, if ever, use a psychedelic alone and never casually: They are taken for a specific reason, with an intention. There is almost always an elder presiding, someone who knows the psychic terrain and can create a suitable container for the experience. And invariably the experience takes place within a structure of ritual.

Dr. Andrew Weil was one of the first to recognize the value of ritual in drug use. In his 1972 book, “The Natural Mind,” he writes:

Ritual seems to protect individuals and groups from the negative effects of drugs, possibly by establishing a framework of order around their use. At least, people who use drugs ritually tend not to get into trouble with them, whereas people who abandon ritual and use drugs wantonly seem to have problems.

Simply borrowing a ritual ceremony from any Indigenous group probably wouldn’t fly in 2021 America and, even if it did, would be an act of cultural appropriation. In my interviews with Native Americans, I encountered a deep reluctance to share with a white journalist exactly what happens during a peyote ceremony. “The Great Spirit gave us this plant a long time ago,” Steven Benally, a Diné leader of the Native American Church, explained when I asked him simply to describe a peyote ceremony. “I’m guessing you’re white, yes? All this information you want, what’s in it for me?” So much has been taken from Native Americans that they are determined to safeguard their peyote and the rituals that accompany it. We non-Natives will need to design our own culturally appropriate containers for the secular, nonmedical psychedelic experience. But that process should be informed by the principles guiding these Indigenous practices, since they are the product of deep experience with these molecules going back thousands of years.

The end of the drug war will confront us with cases more challenging than the psychedelics, several of which have been investigated by scientists as effective treatments for various forms of mental illness. They are also not habit-forming. But what about the so-called hard drugs, like heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine — drugs that people ostensibly take for pleasure? Is there a safe way to fold these more addictive molecules into our lives?

This is uncomfortable territory, partly because few Americans regard pleasure as a legitimate reason to take drugs and partly because the drug war (with its supporters in academia and the media) has produced such a dense fog of misinformation, especially about addiction. Many people (myself included) are surprised to learn that the overwhelming majority of people who take hard drugs do so without becoming addicted. We think of addictiveness as a property of certain chemicals and addiction as a disease that people, in effect, catch from those chemicals, but there is good reason to believe otherwise. Addiction may be less a disease than a symptom — of trauma, social disconnection, depression or economic distress. As the geography of the opioid and meth crises suggests, one’s environment and economic prospects play a large role in the likelihood of becoming addicted; just look at where these deaths of despair tend to cluster or the places where addiction to crack cocaine proliferated.

Two findings underscore this point, both described in Johann Hari’s 2015 book on drug addiction, “Chasing the Scream.” Much of what we know, or believe we know, about drug addiction is based on experiments with rats. Put a rat in a cage with two levers, one giving it heroin or cocaine, the other sugar water, and the rat will reliably opt for the drug until it is addicted or dead. These classic experiments seemed to prove that addiction is the inevitable result of exposure to addictive drugs, a simple matter of biology. But something very different happens when that experimental rat is sprung from solitary confinement and moved to a larger, more pleasant cage outfitted with toys, good food and companions to play and have sex with. This is the so-called rat park experiment, devised by a Canadian psychologist named Bruce Alexander in the 1970s. He and his colleagues found that in this enriched environment, rats will sample the morphine on offer but will consume a small fraction of the amount consumed by rats living in isolation, in some cases five milligrams a day instead of 25. Dr. Alexander came to see that drug abuse isn’t a disease; it’s an adaptation to one’s environment and circumstance — to the condition of one’s cage.

The second phenomenon Mr. Hari recounts took place at the end of the Vietnam War. Some 20 percent of U.S. troops became addicted to heroin while in-country. With the war coming to an end, experts worried about tens of thousands of addicts flooding America’s streets. But something unexpected happened when the addicted service members got home: Ninety-five percent of them simply stopped using. It made no difference whether or not they received drug treatment. This is not to minimize the harm done by heroin to those who couldn’t quit; it is only to suggest that there is much more to addiction than exposure to an addictive drug.

The problem of drug addiction will be with us as long as unhappiness is; waging war on drugs did little to stem it, and it will not vanish with the peace. So what to do about it? Harm reduction is the approach embraced by the voters of Oregon as well as those nations that have decriminalized drugs, including Portugal and Switzerland. That might mean drug treatment, instead of incarceration, to help addicts break their habit, or in some places, actually giving them heroin (and clean needles) to maintain it. This reduces the harm that comes from using street drugs, which are of unknown purity (and nowadays often laced with fentanyl, which has contributed heavily to a rise in opiate overdoses), and from the crimes committed to obtain them. Switzerland has perhaps the most ambitious approach to treating heroin addiction. The government gives you a prescription for heroin but then makes sure you have a job, decent housing and therapeutic support, on the theory you will no longer need the drug after your circumstances improve. The abuse of opiates unquestionably does a tremendous amount of damage to individuals as well as to society. But contrary to the stereotype of spiraling chemical enslavement, some people manage to use opiates habitually while leading productive lives. Many, if not most, of the harms of the practice stem from its prohibition.

We shouldn’t forget that two of the most destructive drugs in use today — alcohol and tobacco — have long been perfectly legal. Having wisely given up on prohibition, we’ve worked hard as a society to regulate their use, deploying both laws and customs. Recognizing the dangers of tobacco, we’ve desocialized its use over the past 50 years, devising rules and taboos about when and where one may smoke. Along with high taxes, these expressions of cultural disapproval have substantially reduced tobacco use. (It’s worth remembering that in many traditional New World cultures, tobacco is used ritually without the harms associated with smoking in the West.)

The uneasy peace our culture has made with alcohol may point to a way drugs like heroin and cocaine might someday be used in the post-war-on-drugs era. As a society, we accept that some people will end up in an unhealthy relationship with alcohol and that tens of thousands will die each year from abusing it. But a great many more will use the same drug with pleasure and without harm, either to themselves or society. Here, too, the rituals we’ve developed around drinking play a protective role and suggest a model, however imperfect. Most of us don’t drink before a certain hour in the day. We drink only in the company of others. We eat food with alcohol; after drinking, we don’t drive — a practice codified in law. The people who follow these rules and rituals are by and large not the people who get into trouble with alcohol.

The drug war’s blunt, black-and-white approach at least had the virtue of simplicity. “Just say no” is certainly easier to follow than “yes, but only this way and not that.” With all illicit drugs lumped together in the drug war, there was no need to take account of their different properties and powers, what they are good for and what they are bad for. Nor did we need to figure out the best cultural container for each of them, the set of rules and rituals and taboos that might allow us to use them safely, productively and, yes, with pleasure.

But if we’re going to end the drug war, figuring that out is precisely the work we’ll need to do. It won’t be easy or simple or quick; indeed, we’re still figuring out how best to manage alcohol and tobacco, striking the right balance of formal regulations, social norms and taxes. (Taxation is important for two reasons: to discourage use and to pay for the associated health costs to society.) And while it is surely the case that the burden of drug abuse (including that of alcohol and tobacco) will fall most heavily on the poor, that argues not for a war on the drugs so much as for a war on poverty — on the conditions of life that make using drugs seem like a reasonable solution or means of self-medication.

The long history of humans and their mind-altering drugs gives us reason to hope we can negotiate a peace with these powerful substances, imperfect though it may be. We have done it before. The ancient Greeks grasped the ambiguous, double-edged nature of drugs much better than we do. Their word for them, “pharmakon,” means both “medicine” and “poison” — it all depends, they understood, on use, dose, intention, set and setting. Blessing or curse, which will it be? The answer depends not on law or chemistry so much as on culture, which is to say, on us."
NYT,"Tim Ferriss, the Man Who Put His Money Behind Psychedelic Medicine",06-Sept-19,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/06/health/ferriss-psychedelic-drugs-depression.html?searchResultPosition=15,"The author of “The 4-Hour Workweek” is behind a surge in funding for clinical research into psychedelic drugs.

The announcement on Wednesday that Johns Hopkins Medicine was starting a new center to study psychedelic drugs for mental disorders was the latest chapter in a decades-long push by health nonprofits and wealthy donors to shake up psychiatry from the outside, bypassing the usual channels.

“Psychiatry is one of the most conservative specialties in medicine,” said David Nichols, a medicinal chemist who founded the Heffter Research Institute in 1993 to fund psychedelic research. “We haven’t really had new drugs for years, and the drug industry has quit the field because they don’t have new targets” in the brain. “The field was basically stagnant, and we needed to try something different.”

The fund-raising for the new Johns Hopkins center was largely driven by the author and investor Tim Ferriss, who said in a telephone interview that he had put aside most of his other projects to advance psychedelic medicine.

“It’s important to me for macro reasons but also deeply personal ones,” Mr. Ferriss, 42, said. “I grew up on Long Island, and I lost my best friend to a fentanyl overdose. I have treatment-resistant depression and bipolar disorder in my family. And addiction. It became clear to me that you can do a lot in this field with very little money.”

Mr. Ferriss provided funds for a similar center at Imperial College London, which was introduced in April, and for individual research projects at the University of San Francisco, California, testing psilocybin as an aide to therapy for distress in long-term AIDS patients.

The spiritual father of psychedelic medicine was the chemist Albert Hofmann, who discovered the effects of LSD in 1943 after accidentally ingesting it while working at the Swiss firm Sandoz. Dr. Hofmann had at least one bad trip — “Everything in the room spun around, and the familiar objects and pieces of furniture assumed grotesque, threatening forms,” he wrote afterward. But he also recognized his “problem child,” as he called the drug, as a potential therapeutic agent.

So did a host of prominent doctors, in time. Beginning in 1960, the renowned Scottish psychiatrist Dr. R.D. Laing gave LSD to patients, some with psychotic disorders, and used it himself. Through the 1960s, other prominent psychiatrists experimented liberally, including Dr. Stanislav Grof, Dr. Humphry Osmond and Dr. Abram Hoffer.

These “treatments” showed promise for some problems, like alcoholism, but the results were mixed, and dosing someone with psychosis would never clear an ethical review committee today.

By 1970, acid and related compounds had become part of a dangerous menu of street drugs, and governments cracked down, bringing research to a near halt. Other mind-altering recreational drugs, like psilocybin (the ingredient in magic mushrooms) and MDMA, or ecstasy, also landed on the lists of banned substances.

The revival of interest began in the early 1990s, when the Food and Drug Administration agreed to approve careful, well-designed, ethically vetted studies of psychedelics for the first time in decades. The Heffter Institute and the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, or MAPS, a nonprofit funded by an assortment of wealthy donors, financed projects in the United States and abroad. MAPS collaborated with Dr. Hofmann and Alexander Shulgin, a former Dow chemist who discovered the effects of ecstasy, and with his wife, Ann, experimented with scores of hallucinogens.

Experiments using ecstasy and LSD, for end-of-life care, were underway by the mid-2000s. Soon, therapists began conducting trials of ecstasy for post-traumatic stress, with promising results. One of the most influential scientific reports appeared in 2006: a test of the effects of a strong dose of psilocybin on healthy adults. In that study, a team led by Roland Griffiths at Johns Hopkins found that the volunteers “rated the psilocybin experience as having substantial personal meaning and spiritual significance and attributed to the experience sustained positive changes in attitudes and behavior.”

At least as important as the findings, which were exploratory, was the source, Johns Hopkins, with all its reputational weight, and no history of institutional bias toward alternative treatments. “I got interested through meditation in altered states of consciousness, and I came into this field with no ax to grind,” said Dr. Griffiths, the director of the new center.

By late 2018, the Johns Hopkins group had reported promising results using psilocybin for depression, nicotine addiction and cancer-related distress. Others around the world, including Dr. David Nutt at Imperial College London, were producing similar results.

Mr. Ferriss, who organized half the $17 million in commitments and contributed more than $2 million of his own for the new Johns Hopkins center, said he approached wealthy friends who he knew had an interest in mental health. The new venture, he said he told them, “truly has the chance to bend the arc of history, and I’ve spent nearly five years looking at and testing options in this space to find the right bet. Would you have any interest in discussing?”

Mr. Ferriss said he met Dr. Griffiths in 2015, became intrigued with the research, and began thinking about the Johns Hopkins group as he might an investment bet. He launched a crowdfunding campaign for a small depression study, to see how efficiently the Johns Hopkins team used the money. “Essentially it was a seed investment,” Mr. Ferriss said. “I ran a beta test, and they really delivered.”

Craig Nerenberg, one of those friends and the founder of the hedge fund Brenner West Capital Partners, quickly agreed to contribute. “I have lost a family member to addiction and have felt the pain of loved ones who struggled through depression,” Mr. Nerenberg said by email. “It’s hard for me to imagine a contribution that I can make which — if the research data continues to bear out — will have a greater impact over the next decade.”

The remaining half of the commitments for the center came from the Steven &amp; Alexandra Cohen Foundation and supports studies on the benefits for people with persistent Lyme disease symptoms, PTSD and other conditions. Mr. Cohen is a billionaire investor; the foundation focuses on education, veterans issues, Lyme disease and children’s health, among other concerns. In an email, Ms. Cohen wrote, “I strongly believe that we must dare to change the minds of those who think this drug is for recreational purposes only and acknowledge that it is a miracle for many who are desperate for relief from their symptoms or for the ability to cope with their illnesses. It may even save lives.”

Investigators at the Johns Hopkins center, its counterpart at Imperial College London and elsewhere still have an enormous amount of work to do to learn which mind-altering substances are beneficial for whom, at what doses, and when such treatment is dangerous. The same concerns that shut down similar research in the 1970s are audible in the caution expressed by many psychiatrists today: These are powerfully mind-altering substances, and administering them to people who are already unstable is uncertain work, to put it mildly. One scary adverse event could cripple the whole enterprise.

But for now, the supporters of a revived psychedelic medicine are taking a victory lap. “It’s taken half a century since the backlash against the psychedelic ’60s, but cultural evolution takes time,” said Rick Doblin, executive director of MAPS. “We’re seeing a global renaissance in public and scientific interest, regulatory approvals and funding for psychedelic research.”"

Abraham Verghese wrote about the threat that the transition to electronic health records poses to physicians' clinical judgment.

Abraham Verghese's article eloquently describes the debacle of the mass and hasty implementation of electronic health-record technology that occurred in response to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. The health-information-technology industry certainly bears the responsibility for producing and deploying a vast amount of software that was far from ready for prime time.

Whereas Verghese's article offered little hope that the tech can offer a remedy to what ails the health system, I actually believe that the rule ''you break it, you own it'' sheds light on a path forward. Leading companies in this industry have acknowledged that we broke it and that we therefore own it and are determined to fix it. As a result, significant efforts are underway to improve E.H.R. usability and reduce physician burnout by incorporating advanced machine-learning capabilities to anticipate and predict documentation and intervention sequences. Interoperability, maligned in Verghese's article, is actually allowing data to be shared across health systems, enhancing safety and quality. Big-data analytics are transforming the way physicians care for populations of patients. The industry has better days ahead. We broke it, we own it. Dr. Betty Rabinowitz, chief medical officer of NextGen Healthcare

I'm a millennial who's old enough to remember paper carbon-copy orders that we, as students, would file at the nurses' station, yet young enough to have used electronic health records since my intern year. Despite their shortcomings, I still find that E.H.R.s provide a great boon to the overall work flow. An E.H.R. progress note full of pre-populated text is absolutely dreadful to read. But to paraphrase a mentor of mine: ''It's like you guys were given a Cadillac and you don't know how to use it.''

I type my notes as if I'm writing by hand. It's my responsibility, not a program's, to make sure what's in my note is accurate. E.H.R.s can be programmed to shame those who copy and paste: Pasted text is clearly marked on a new note. Everyone can see that the writer copied it. Upcoding is easier with E.H.R.s, and thus more annoying to providers. But upcoding is not inherent to E.H.R.s. That's on your boss and the payor. The electronic interoperability between hospitals for medical records is dependent on ease of consent and the hospitals' lawyers and their interpretation of privacy laws. The function is there, and I have used it on the rare occasion when it works. Grant Lee, St. Cloud, Minn.

RE: TRIP DOCTORS

Michael Pollan wrote about the use of therapeutic psychedelic drugs.

While Michael Pollan survived the dissolution of his ego defenses after ingesting psilocybin, other people with mental illness or difficulty coping with life may not be so lucky. The frightening drug-induced psychosis he describes could overwhelm remaining constraints keeping someone from violence or suicide. The fascination with psychedelic drugs, psychosurgery, brain-stimulation devices, intravenous infusions, etc., is symptomatic of the current mental health crisis.

Mental health care begins with a thorough evaluation to identify causes of illness whether socioeconomic, psychological or biological. Once properly diagnosed, a majority of people can benefit from proven effective and safe interventions that may include psychotherapy or medications. The dangers of guided psychedelic ''journeys'' include not only adverse drug-reactions but also discouraging people from seeking effective care and promoting drug abuse. The real problems in mental health care are continuing stigma, misinformation and barriers to availability, access and affordability of established therapies. Stanley N. Caroff, professor of psychiatry, Perelman School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania

Michael Pollan is clarifying what those of us who have used many types of illicit drugs have known: There are bad drugs and there are good drugs. As a 25-year-old college student, I was heavily addicted to alcohol and opiates. Luckily, I encountered psilocybin, and after several difficult but enlightening trips, I gave up alcohol and pills for good. I am now 33, married and the mother of two children, leading a sober life. The psilocybin awakened my spirit. There are many others who have had this experience ''underground.'' The psychedelics work. Let's hope this research can continue because this could be an answer to the opioid crisis, not to mention the spiritual malaise that is so prevalent in my generation. Lauren Heeren, DeLand, Fla."
NYT,Jon Hopkins’s Psychedelic Journey to a New Way of Creating Music,10-Nov-21,https://www.nytimes.com/2021/11/10/arts/music/jon-hopkins-music-for-psychedelic-therapy.html?searchResultPosition=19,"For more than a decade, the British producer’s muscle and grace made him a festival favorite. His new album, “Music for Psychedelic Therapy,” takes an unexpectedly quiet turn.

When Jon Hopkins was bullied as a London teenager, he found two complementary coping mechanisms: weed and ambient music.

A little sullen and shy, Hopkins was a contest-winning classical pianist who also adored the ineffable mystery of electronic pop production, huddling near the stereo to wonder how exactly Depeche Mode or Abba worked. Just as he started to approximate some of those sounds, his world faltered. Old friends at his all-boys school became enemies. His parents split. He would retire to his room, get stoned, lie down and enter a new dimension, alone inside headphones.

“I would disappear into other realms, hiding in this kaleidoscopic world of magic,” Hopkins, 42, said in a phone interview, announcing that he was lying on a gray couch in the dim recording studio attached to his East London home. “For years, I looked down on that period because I thought I was just escaping, too sensitive to deal with life. But I was learning. That was the formation of everything.”

Shaken by his weed habit and concomitant isolation (both short-lived), Hopkins didn’t take another drug for a decade. But 15 years ago, a psilocybin trip on a remote Scottish shore revealed new wonder with the world, sparking an interest in the benefits of altered states so profound that Hopkins will release a new album called “Music for Psychedelic Therapy” on Friday.

A 64-minute rhythmless expanse of delicate electronics, immersive natural sounds and celestial choirs, it is meant to soundtrack a ketamine trip or, more broadly, guide listeners toward their own “other realms.” After more than a decade as a feted producer for artists including Coldplay and Purity Ring — and three lauded LPs and an array of smaller projects since 2009 of his own — Hopkins has gone quieter, in an ambient way.

“There’s no way the extraordinary beauty of these moments cannot enhance your life,” Hopkins said of that seaside morning that changed his trajectory, and a more recent odyssey amid the Mojave’s Joshua trees. “I’m not advocating for people doing these things, but, for me, they keep the wonder of being alive present.” (Medical experts recommend using psilocybin or ketamine only with a doctor’s prescription, and warn of risks associated with their casual use.)

“When you live in a city, you can forget how extraordinary it is that anything exists at all,” he added.

It is fitting that “Music for Psychedelic Therapy” began taking shape in an uncomfortable way for Hopkins — by descending 200 feet beneath the Ecuadorean rain forest into a cave teeming with scorpions, tarantulas and bats, his neighbors for four days and three nights.

At a summer festival in 2017, the musician met Eileen Hall, the daughter of a Scottish civil engineer who led a gold-seeking expedition into Cueva de los Tayos in the 1970s that prompted the identification of several hundred species and an ongoing campaign to secure UNESCO World Heritage status. A painter fascinated by the intersection of psychedelics and spirituality, Hall hoped to build on her father’s legacy through artistic residencies that found new ways to express existence underground.

She expected Hopkins to pass politely on her 2018 invitation, as he prepared for a spree of tours behind “Singularity,” the album he released months before the planned trek. “It’s a nuts thing,” Hall said by phone, laughing, “to go into a massive hole in the ground in the middle of nowhere in a country he’d never been to with people he didn’t know.”

But Hopkins immediately said yes, telling his management to mark it as vacation. He flew to Ecuador’s capital, Quito, in a haze induced by two sleepless nights of partying at an enormous festival he headlined. His instinct made instant sense.

“The part of my brain looking for something to fix or worry about quieted down,” Hopkins said. A practitioner of Transcendental Meditation and the breathing ideas of the Dutch endurance athlete Wim Hof, Hopkins felt as if he disappeared into the earth itself while perched on a rock inside a cathedral-size chamber. “There were some moments of actual silence in my head.”

As Hopkins’s peers snapped photographs, made films and captured the Tayos soundscape, he relished in the mission’s most laissez-faire charge: to absorb his surroundings and, someday, translate them into music. He presumed the 20-minute collage he recorded — a flow state of ecstatic bird song and rushing water captured underground, undergirded by seraphic drones — would be a stand-alone release. But then, a 1975 talk by the hallucinogenic mystic Ram Dass at a Unitarian church in Massachusetts arrived in his inbox.

[Video: Watch on YouTube.]

Trevor Oswalt, an artist who records psychoactive soundtracks sporting names like “Music for Mushrooms” and “Spores” as East Forest, had also become a new friend. Years earlier, Oswalt had visited Dass in Maui, recording conversations he turned into a winsome collection of inspirational tunes. When Dass died in late 2019, his foundation, Love Remember Serve, dispatched a clutch of archival lectures to Oswalt, who came to Hopkins for help.

Oswalt had already stripped the two-hour reel of overt religious content, creating a 15-minute edit. “We wanted something universal and uplifting, that’s hard to argue with,” Oswalt said in a video interview from his studio, a painting of Dass peering over his shoulder.

In October 2020, Hopkins sat at the polished upright piano in the corner of his own studio, improvising to his first impressions of Dass’s words. “Quiet the mind. Open the heart,” Dass encouraged in a voice as calming as a cup of chamomile. This, Hopkins realized, was an album’s end; the music he’d found in Ecuadorean silence was its beginning.

“I always know when the spark of something has appeared,” he said. “That is one of the best feelings, when you know something is going to be important.”

Hopkins spent the next four months of lockdown searching for tones to fill the frame, finding the right sounds serendipitously — in a beer glass he tapped, and the noise from a software fail. He shipped tracks to Dan Kijowski, a childhood friend with whom he had shared several psychedelic trips, and Kijowski broadcast them through eight speakers suspended in trees around his family farm, recording the playback. Hopkins wove the results into the album, repeatedly listening from his studio’s couch until he knew this was his paragon of music for psychedelic therapy.

“On previous records, I’d been aware I wanted them to do well commercially, that I needed a big track,” Hopkins said, frowning beneath the thin beard that framed his patrician face. “This was an opportunity to drop every level of pretense. I was just trying to translate the honest experience of living.”

The album feels so personal that Hopkins doesn’t know if, when or how he will perform it live, a potential violation of its sacred intimacy. The record is instead being played at a series of small listening events through powerful speakers, like a ritualistic sound bath. Hopkins attended the September premiere in Texas, watching as a few hundred people sprawled on the floor, as he did as a bullied teenager. Some cried. Others chanted.

Hopkins hadn’t anticipated how vulnerable the experience would feel. “Oh my God, what have you done? You’ve revealed everything,” he thought to himself, made anxious by his own prescription. Oswalt remembered Hopkins pacing the floor and fiddling with earplugs, as if working through preperformance jitters. But when “Sit Around the Fire,” the Dass-narrated finale, began, Hopkins climbed onstage to improvise an alternate grand-piano ending. He was cured.

“It’s an analogy for my life, really: I can sit there in an anxious state, overthinking things,” he said, chuckling nervously. “Then I go play, and it all makes sense again.”"
NYT,"In the Pandemic, a Shifting Ballot Debate on Legalizing Drugs",26-Oct-20,https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/26/us/drug-marijuana-legalization-ballot-measures.html?searchResultPosition=24,"Marijuana measures are on the ballot in several states that once resisted them. Oregon would go further with a proposal to decriminalize drugs like heroin, cocaine and methamphetamine.

Oregon has an addiction problem. Pockets of rural poverty, chronic homelessness and cities with lots of young people have given the state one of the highest rates of substance abuse in the nation. It is also, because there is so little money allocated to it, one of the toughest places to get treatment.

A proposed solution on the ballot next week would be one of the most radical drug-law overhauls in the nation’s history, eliminating criminal penalties entirely for personal use amounts of drugs such as heroin, methamphetamine and cocaine. Tax revenues from drug sales would be channeled toward drug treatment.

Supporters of the Oregon proposal, Measure 110, say the swirling, transformational forces of 2020 — the coronavirus pandemic, as well as the wave of social unrest over race, policing and incarceration — have highlighted a need for top-to-bottom change. Opponents say decriminalization courts disaster by normalizing drugs that carry the risk of deadly addiction.

Oregon is far from alone in stepping out onto new terrain. Legal marijuana, stalled for years in politically conservative states even as more left-leaning areas plowed ahead, has found a place on the ballot this year in Arizona, Mississippi, Montana and South Dakota. National groups that have long dreamed of a federal overhaul of drug laws say that success in those states could bring Republican elected officials into Congress with constituents who have said yes to legalization, potentially tipping the balance in Washington.

Money is an undercurrent everywhere, as many state budgets face big shortfalls as a result of the drop-off in consumer spending during the pandemic, forcing a search for alternative tax sources.

“The pandemic has only highlighted and intensified the need for new options,” said Sam Chapman, the campaign manager for Yes on 109, a separate drug measure on the ballot in Oregon that would make psilocybin, the psychoactive ingredient in magic mushrooms, legal for mental health treatment. Voters in Washington, D.C., will decide in a ballot measure there whether to make possession of fungi-based psychedelics the lowest level of police priority, but Oregon would be the first with a statewide treatment policy. “We all know someone who is suffering,” Mr. Chapman said.

Dave Lewis, a Republican who served in the Montana Legislature and as state budget director under three governors over a 42-year public career, framed the argument for legal recreational marijuana in his state as the counterpunch in a fight Montana needs to win.

“This Covid thing is kicking our butts,” said Mr. Lewis, 78, who is advising the group backing recreational marijuana legalization, though he is not, he said, a consumer himself or much interested in becoming one.

Mr. Lewis said that a sharp decline in visitors, as people have been locked down at home around the country, has hit Montana’s outdoor tourist economy hard; marijuana legalization could contribute 4,000 or 5,000 new jobs, according to an analysis by the University of Montana. “That’s huge in Montana — my goodness gracious, we’re like 44th in family income,” he said.

Half the tax revenue from the Montana measure is pledged to public lands and outdoor recreation — an estimated $18 million a year — which has brought in powerful new political allies, including the Montana Wildlife Federation and the Trust for Public Lands, both of which have signed on as supporters.

In New Jersey, which is bracing for an 18 percent decline in tax revenues next year, the drug debate is framed around the police and police budgets. Gov. Phil Murphy, a Democrat, is backing a recreational marijuana measure on the ballot, telling voters that saying yes to legalization would save tens of millions of dollars and allow police officers to focus on more serious public safety threats.

In South Dakota, where voters will decide on medical marijuana and recreational sales in two separate ballot measures, a key pitch is a plan to allocate half of the revenues from recreational marijuana taxes to public schools.

“People know the government needs money, and the schools definitely need money,” said Drey Samuelson, the political director of South Dakotans for Better Marijuana Laws, the group that sponsored legalization.

Opponents of drug legalization argue that the need to find new revenues during the pandemic may be leading people to grasp at straws — and leaving them prone to being manipulated and misled.

In Mississippi, the Legislature has inserted itself into the debate over a measure to legalize medical marijuana. Lawmakers put a separate measure of their own on the ballot that would give them the power to decide how any legalization is put into place.

In Nebraska, where a medical marijuana measure qualified for the ballot, an antidrug group sued and the State Supreme Court last month struck it from the ballot. In South Dakota, opposition has been led by the state’s Chamber of Commerce, which argues that highway and worker safety will suffer.

Opponents to the hard-drug decriminalization measure in Oregon say it would lead to more addiction both by making drugs easier to get and also by removing law enforcement and the courts from the equation.

Currently, many people arrested with small amounts of opiates or other drugs are offered a way out of criminal prosecution through a diversion into treatment and counseling. But without a judge forcing the issue, opponents said, many people will not face up to an addiction problem.

“The sad reality is that many, many people will never seek treatment without the motivation of criminal charges,” said Paige Clarkson, a prosecutor in Marion County, Ore., and the president of the Oregon District Attorneys Association.

The American Psychiatric Association and the Oregon Psychiatric Physicians Association both oppose the state’s psilocybin proposal because they say that while the drug has indeed shown medical promise — the federal Food and Drug Administration last year called psilocybin a potential “breakthrough therapy” for treating major depression — the measure’s proponents are going too far by saying it might help everything from anxiety disorders to addiction.

Across the country, backers of these new drug measures say that the old ways simply have not worked, and that the pandemic has made everything worse. Covid-19 outbreaks in jails and a growing awareness of how many people of color have been imprisoned for drug offenses make a potent new argument, supporters said, for thinking another way.

“Voters, and people at large, increasingly understand that now, especially, is not the time to be arresting somebody for drug addiction,” said Peter Zuckerman, the campaign manager for the 110 measure. “Drug addiction is a health issue; it deserves a health response,” he added.

Both sides in Oregon’s decriminalization debate do agree on one thing, though — that the state’s drug problems have gotten worse. A decade ago, according to federal health reports, Oregon was 10th worst in the nation in the proportion of residents with a substance abuse disorder, including alcohol. By 2016-17, in the most recent rankings, it had the fourth-highest rate. At the same time, the percentage of people who needed treatment but were not receiving it rose from ninth to third worst in the nation.

And while some states that already have legalized marijuana have not realized as much in new tax revenue as had been hoped — California, for example, had trouble luring marijuana buyers away from the black market — the pandemic has been good for legal marijuana sales in Oregon.

Demand has soared, up almost 75 percent between March and August of this year, giving the state budget a jolt of tax revenue in the process."
NYT,The Highs and Lows of LSD Literature,12-Jun-19,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/12/books/lsd-books-pollan-waldman-doyle.html?searchResultPosition=26,"It can seem as though everyone in Silicon Valley is either heading to or coming back from a psychedelic trip, and it is probably Michael Pollan’s fault.

He did after all write a best seller, “How to Change Your Mind,” about how healthful psychedelics can be. His neighbor Ayelet Waldman, whose   memoir “A Really Good Day” recounts how taking acid helped her mood and marriage, has something to do with it, too. And now, inspired by Pollan, the writer T.C. Boyle has a new novel,   “Outside Looking In,” about Timothy Leary, the charismatic Harvard professor turned psychedelics   pied piper of the 1960s.

In the past year, psychedelics have entered the mainstream conversation in a way not seen since then. But now LSD and magic mushrooms aren’t for fun or adventure, but for wellness, life-hacking,   therapy and   self-care. The Milken Conference, a   business event featuring the leaders of major banks, had   a panel called “Psychedelics: Mind-Enhancing Methods to Well-Being.” There is a seemingly endless array of psychedelic   health events. And no group has embraced psychedelics like   Silicon Valley engineers.

On a recent afternoon, Waldman, who like Pollan lives in Berkeley, came to his house for lunch. The two had gotten into psychedelics only in their 50s, and their interest was a mix of academic, spiritual and therapeutic. Boyle, in town for his book tour, joined. Unlike the other two, Boyle had used drugs liberally in his youth and entirely for fun. (Boyle is recently retired from teaching writing at U.S.C., though he prefers the term “pre-dead.”) Over lunch, the three talked about the flood of freshly minted shamans, Gwyneth Paltrow’s wellness brand Goop and whether hallucinogens belong at company gatherings.

‘These people became shamans, like, last week’

Hallucinogens can be a particularly jarring, grueling high, and Pollan and Waldman both took the drugs with shaman guides in undisclosed locations. (The drugs are still illegal, after all.) Both found the experience to be life changing, giving them new insights into themselves and their lives. Now they worry about how many people are following their lead. A booming — and unregulated — shaman market has emerged.

“Now when you leave the airport in Quito, there are people with signs for ‘ayahuasca ceremony’ instead of ‘taxi,’” Pollan said. “These people became shamans, like, last week. People are getting hurt.” It’s not as if there’s a licensing board.

All the guys Pollan knew before are booked months out. Suddenly a lot more people are calling themselves experts.

Plus, there is the tricky issue of American wellness seekers taking over South American spiritual ceremonies.

“There’s just something that makes me uncomfortable about a bunch of white people overrunning all these shaman experiences,” Waldman said.

Pollan agreed.

It’s a complicated concern for two people who have just published books about the benefits of psychedelics. They worry about the ayahuasca retreat gentrification even as they usher more people in the door.

Boyle, who wears a goatee and shaggy hair, does not worry as much about this as his Berkeley friends do. Nor does he share the same shamanic spiritual experiences or drug-related wellness goals. “Me, I was just a druggie — I wasn’t looking for enlightenment,” Boyle said. “The LSD we took, the mescaline and so on, it’s just bought from some guy on the street corner, we didn’t know what it was.”

The ‘Goop-ification’

The new psychedelic movement — in which microdosing is for productivity — would not approve.

And the booming wellness industry is ready with promises of what psychedelics can do for you (spoiler alert: almost everything). Goop, Gwyneth Paltrow’s health and beauty brand, now regularly features pieces with voices touting the health benefits of the drugs, claiming MDMA makes talk therapy more effective or   ayahuasca increases a person’s appreciation of nature.

“The Goop-ification is happening,” Waldman said. She seems skeptical.

Waldman took on the soft but authoritative voice of a yoga instructor as she jokingly described how psychedelics might be rebranded.

“You know you take your jade egg, roll it in a little acid, and you shove it up your —,” Waldman said, making a swift upward motion with her hand as everyone around the table laughed. “Absorb it through your mucous membranes and it gives you a kind of extraordinary experience.”

The Trump effect

“Do you guys think Trump has something to do with it?” Pollan called from the kitchen where he was heating up pizza from the The Cheese Board Collective in Berkeley.

“I couldn’t get through Trump without something,” Waldman responded.

Pollan argues that the new interest in psychedelics comes from the growing anxiety in American society today — and not just from the erratic president.

“I think people want these kind of more intense experiences than they’re getting being online,” Pollan said.

The very people who funded the screens are now backing the things to cure people from their effects.

Venture capitalists are getting involved as a new gold rush stirs. Unusual new financiers are finding common cause with would-be hippies. The conservative investor Peter Thiel is backing a psychedelics-for-wellness start-up.

Pollan is now spending at least some of his time trying to stop people from using psychedelics at corporate off-sites. At a recent psychedelic conference at the Esalen Institute in Big Sur, he met a 20-something entrepreneur whose start-up had closed a large round of funding and was now hiring.

“He’d come to the conference because he thought he could use psychedelics in his management training,” Pollan said. “And I tried to give him some cautionary notes. Like, ‘You know, you may want to go public one day.’”

Waldman argued that it could be a good idea to incorporate psychedelics into a company off-site, “as long as it’s not compulsory.”

The legalization question

But no one at the table that day in Berkeley was arguing for full legalization.

Pollan, who wrote extensively and positively about his time using psilocybin, wrote an op-ed in May warning against legalization after   Colorado effectively decriminalized it.

“Psilocybin has a lot of potential as medicine, but we don’t know enough about it yet to legalize it,” Pollan wrote.

“The lesson from ancient cultures that use psychedelics in their healing or their religion is that they always have a kind of container and an elder involved,” Pollan said. “You did them on certain occasions, and you did it with the clear intent.”

Waldman’s book focused on her experience microdosing, which in her case meant taking small amounts of LSD while continuing her daily life. She said microdosing should probably have different rules. But then again, someone could just take a bunch of microdoses and get high.

New drug trials are underway to study how psychedelics might treat depression, and Pollan sees potential dangers.

“Someone is probably going to commit suicide because they’re getting off of SSRIs,” Pollan said. “I do think we could have another backlash.”

“There will be a terrible backlash if these are suddenly released to the public,” Waldman said.

They talk about bad trips they have been on, even ones that were carefully curated with the best shamans and the finest drugs. (Waldman recently believed she was vomiting rats.)

“Tom, did you ever have a bad experience?” Pollan asked.

Boyle laughed to himself a little.

“I never had a good experience,” Boyle said.

Boyle added that there is another category everyone is forgetting: the people who just want to get high. “We’re old people.”"
NYT,A Reckoning With an Imperfect Science in ‘Blue Dreams’,03-Apr-18,,"BLUE DREAMS The Science and the Story of the Drugs That Changed Our Minds By Lauren Slater 400 pp. Little, Brown & Company. $28.

In 1988, Lauren Slater put a single cream-and-green pill in her mouth and, with a sip of water, became one of the first patients in the United States to take Prozac. She also emerged as one of its most poetic chroniclers when she detailed her heady, complex love affair with the drug in “Prozac Diary” (1998).

Thirty years since that first dose, neither Slater nor the drug has aged particularly well. Slater, who has spent much of her life wrestling with bipolar and obsessive-compulsive disorders, jumped from an initial prescription of 10 milligrams to 20 to 30 to 60, landing at 80 mg, which is where she left off in “Prozac Diary.” A doctor eventually upped her dose to 100 mg a day — 20 beyond what’s F.D.A. approved. But the drug that had “so magically removed the dead-weight symptoms so that my whole world became a gorgeous glimmer” ceased working once again. Many psychiatrists theorize that each relapse makes the brain more vulnerable to future episodes and leads to a lifetime of antidepressants for people who have had depressive episodes. At the same time, Slater notes, few studies have examined the long-term side effects of these serotonin boosters.

Slater’s current medicine cabinet includes the antidepressant Effexor, the antipsychotic Zyprexa, another antipsychotic, Abilify, the stimulant Vyvanse, the anti-anxiety medication Klonopin, as well as Lisiniprol to combat the high blood pressure caused by Effexor. Add in some of the other psychotropic medications she’s tried — Imipramine, Geodon, Risperdal, lithium — and it starts to read like a pharmacist’s daily fill list.

But it’s Zyprexa and its side effect of increased appetite that particularly shadows Slater. Her mouth waters at the mention of food. She scoops marshmallow fluff out of a jar and downs several enchiladas at a time heaped with mole sauce. Now at 160 pounds on her 5-foot frame, she is diabetic and in kidney failure, her mouth thick with thirst and her urine thick with sediment. “A single warning from a single doctor when I was in the depths of despair,” she writes, “could not adequately convey the message that by swallowing this new drug I was effectively agreeing to deeply damage the body upon which I rely to survive.” Her attempts to withdraw from medications have proved disastrous: She once bought a gun and another time wrote suicide letters to her children, before retreating back to the blanket of meds again.

The story of Slater’s attempts to get and stay well weaves throughout “Blue Dreams: The Science and the Story of the Drugs That Changed Our Minds” and provides some of the book’s most poignant and lyrical writing. Just as important, her experience makes her a convincing travel guide into the history, creation and future of psychotropics. She is, understandably, not an uncritical cheerleader. But she resists the facile role of hard-charging prosecutor. And no wonder, really, given that the drugs have allowed her to have two children, write nine books, marry (and divorce) and hold dear friendships.

So, when she takes us back to the 1950s and the story of Thorazine, she doesn’t just give us a “One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest” bag of horrors, but also a glimpse into doctors’ excitement when the drug quelled patients’ delusions and hallucinations and the once-comatose resumed living. A former barber, who had been in a haze for years and for whom all previous treatments failed, returned to shaving (his first customer: the doctor who gave him Thorazine). A juggler asked for billiard balls and began juggling again. And people on one psychiatric ward picked up musical instruments, used drills and saws, held conversations that had been unthinkable shortly before.

In what becomes a through-line in the book, no one fully understood how the drug worked (nor do we know what happened to the juggler or barber once they left the asylum). It was simply enough that it seemed to be working. And yet, in high doses and over the long term, patients often experienced tardive dyskinesia, which includes tongue thrusting, lip smacking, restlessness, involuntary movements of arms and legs, which become twisted like pretzels. When Slater wonders aloud to a psychiatrist why the new class of antipsychotics is really so much better than the old ones, he says: “You have to pick your poisons. Which would you rather be in two years — a circus freak or a diabetic?”

She takes us on similar journeys into lithium and MAO inhibitors, each bringing hope and problems. And then, in the late 1980s there’s the arrival of serotonin reuptake inhibitors, known as SSRIs, and their promise to be different from the antidepressants of the past. The standard explanation is that Prozac, Celexa, Zoloft and other SSRIs boost serotonin levels. But studies have never proved that depressed people suffer from low serotonin (some do, some have normal levels and others have high levels). And SSRIs often fare no better than placebos for mild to moderate depression. Still, doctors tend to talk about depression as if the science is settled, often telling patients: If you’re diabetic you take insulin; if you’re depressed you take a pill. The analogy, of course, doesn’t hold. There is no blood test, no X-ray, no urinalysis that pinpoints depression. It is a field, Slater writes, “still stuttering, with at best a slippery grasp on the science behind its pills and potions, a legion of medical men and women who can help you in one way but hurt you in another.”

Hope does arrive in the second half of “Blue Dreams,” when Slater walks us through emerging interventions. Unfortunately, by this point she’s taken us through so much material and still has so far to go — including brain stimulation and memory drugs — that the journey begins to feel too wide-ranging and, occasionally, too thin on details about what we’re passing along the way.

Still, several of the up-and-coming treatments — many of them not new at all — shift our focus from unmediated pill popping. Among them are placebos, which don’t work for all patients and have no effect on those with Alzheimer’s. But, as Slater rightly notes, numerous studies show their amazing potency, which remains too untapped by a psychiatry field still enthralled with drugs.

Like placebos, hallucinogens also aren’t new, of course, but researchers are repurposing them in promising ways. Studies show that psilocybin, the active ingredient in so-called magic mushrooms, curbs smoking addiction, as well as relieves anxiety and depression for people with end-stage cancer. And in clinical trials, psychotherapy combined with MDMA (the chemical more commonly known as ecstasy) offers significant relief for PTSD sufferers. The drug, which creates feelings of empathy and euphoria, allows traumatized victims to recall their terrors in a calm state of mind and establish deep trust with their therapists — ingredients that pave the way for psychological change.

One of the keys for MDMA, psilocybin and some placebo therapies is the connection between patient and provider. And connection is exactly what vanishes during Slater’s own depressive states. Her primary feeling, she writes, is “the loss of love — my people falling away — and the loss of language, my words dwindling so low that my thought seems to move without rhythm or reason.”

It’s no surprise that Slater goes searching for relief among these new treatments. She tracks down a therapist who uses MDMA in her practice. And in the cozy office painted in calming colors, Slater tells the therapist her history and lists her prescriptions. MDMA won’t work for Slater, the therapist tells her; her current medications would block the drug’s effects. Slater knows from past experiences that she can’t risk weaning herself from the prescriptions that keep her stable. Her dependency on our terribly imperfect drugs has ruled out her candidacy for more promising ones."
NYT,Molly at the Marriott: Inside America’s Premier Psychedelics Conference,06-May-17,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/06/style/psychedelic-drug-resurgence-daily-life.html?searchResultPosition=37,"OAKLAND, Calif. — In a packed, cavernous space one weekend late in April, a crowd of thousands was becoming increasingly amped up. Rainbow hair was commonplace, purple silk pants were sighted, and the smell of marijuana drifted in from a designated smoking area nearby. Audience members watched the stage with avid interest, leaping to occasionally shoeless feet to applaud and cheer.

This wasn’t Coachella, taking place the same weekend some 500 miles south, or any other music festival, but a five-day convention of the   Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS), its first in four years. Rather than rock stars, scientists from schools like Johns Hopkins and N.Y.U. were the main attraction, bringing evidence to the medical case for psychedelics like   psilocybin (the active ingredient in magic mushrooms) to assuage end-of-life anxiety, to help deepen meditation practices, to search for the shared underpinnings of spiritual life, and — in a new study — to explore a possible treatment for severe depression.

Paul Austin, 26, of Grand Rapids, Mich., a so-called social entrepreneur who runs a website called The Third Wave devoted to getting out information on psychedelic substances, had come to meet other members of the pro-psychedelic community and share with them his vision for how the next generation must proceed. “A lot of the people who are leading the movement now are 60 or 70 years old, based in academia or research,” Mr. Austin said. “But to catalyze change, you have to speak to people, get to them on an emotional level.”

The conference was taking place just over the Bay Bridge from the city that introduced psychedelics to the American imagination in the early 1960s, when LSD was relatively new, legal and regarded by those who used it as a portal to expanded consciousness, a deeper life and an enlightened, humane society. (Cary Grant and other Hollywood stars were among those who experimented with it as part of their psychotherapeutic process.)

But that vision, as closely associated with San Francisco’s past as the tech industry is with its present, did not play out as advocates had hoped, and California banned the substance in 1966.

Over 50 years later, the advocates gathered here believe that psychedelic drugs, from LSD to magic mushrooms to MDMA (also known as Ecstasy or Molly), are taking a place in mainstream life. “We are not the counterculture,” said Rick Doblin, the executive director of MAPS, “we are the culture.”

The 3,000 or so attendees were a striking mix of ages and types: academics in blazers side by side with a demographic more typically associated with Burning Man than with carpeted conference rooms at the Marriott. They were united by a fierce attachment to the belief that psychedelic drugs, far from being a recreational diversion, have the potential to enlighten, cure illness and change the way people relate to one another and our planet.

Arguably no one is more instrumental in the campaign to make psychedelics commonplace than Mr. Doblin. Since 1986, when he founded the nonprofit MAPS organization, he has raised more than $40 million from sources like Dr. Richard Rockefeller,   Dr. Bronner’s Soap and the   Libra Foundation, funded by the Pritzker family. Mr. Doblin decided to focus about 90 percent of MAPS’s resources on MDMA, which he argues is not freighted with the same history as LSD, a symbol of antiwar protests and anti-government hippies. It is also “less psychologically challenging,” he said, referring to the effects it has on one’s thought process, though some clinicians might argue otherwise.

Mr. Doblin is determined to avoid the flagrant disruptiveness of the earlier psychedelic movement, to which President Richard M. Nixon reacted by declaring LSD a Schedule 1 drug, the highest level of prohibited substance, in 1970. Back then, Mr. Doblin said, most Americans were still unfamiliar with yoga and mindfulness, and resistant to discussing such subjects as death. But “this is a time of incredible peril for the human species and for the health of the planet,” he said. “There’s this sense of crisis, and at the same time, the recognition that the solution is going be spiritual and psychological, rather than material.”

Mr. Doblin said it’s imperative to work with the government; to show up in a suit and tie; to make sure it’s understood that his cause, advancing the legal use of psychedelics, “is not for the hippies, this is not for the crazies out in California. This is for the red states, this is for people facing ‘despair deaths.’ This is for the mainstream.”

Mr. Doblin and his team have been studying the potential therapeutic use of MDMA for post-traumatic stress disorder, for which they are now entering Phase 3, the final one necessary to gain approval from the Food and Drug Administration. They are hopeful that MDMA will be a legal prescription drug by 2021 to be used in therapy. And the election of President Trump has not dampened their optimism: On the contrary, Mr. Doblin maintains that Mr. Trump’s general antipathy toward regulation will make it easier for experimental drugs to get F.D.A. approval.

Other figures long associated with the psychedelic movement have also turned to science. Amanda Feilding, also known as the Countess of Wemyss and March, is a member of the movement’s old guard, having discovered LSD in England in the 1960s.

It is hard to talk about Ms. Feilding without mentioning the fact that in 1970, she drilled a small hole into her skull to help “expand her consciousness,” a practice known as trepanation. Now she was sitting in a bright conference room in Oakland, dressed in her signature shades of emerald green and holding up photo after photo of neuroimaging results, depicting brains flushed with neon trails of activity. They were all from research supported by the Beckley Foundation, which Ms. Feilding founded in 1998 to fight back against the stigmatization and illegality of psychedelic drugs.

“These compounds have become so taboo that in order to reintegrate them into society, we have to use the very best scientific evidence as to how they work in the brain, how they can be beneficial to mankind,” she said, displaying a photograph comparing brain activity on LSD to a normal, nontripping baseline, to point out that in the LSD brains, there’s a large increase in “connectivity,” or neurons talking to one another, giving credence to the long-held idea that an acid trip can lead to new ideas.

Not that lying on the floor in a wowed-out stupor is for everyone, especially the multitaskers of the 21st century.

And this perhaps is why microdosing — the practice of taking such small doses of a psychedelic that you can only just barely register its presence — is becoming enormously popular across the country, from elite pockets of innovators seeking an edge in Silicon Valley, to others who are simply trying to feel better, work harder, focus more. Its effects are so subtle, so slight, that it “doesn’t scare anybody,” said James Fadiman, a psychologist who took part in some of the original research on LSD in the 1960s.

When the drug was declared illegal, many of his compatriots like Timothy Leary and Ken Kesey continued to devote their time to it, but Mr. Fadiman went straight. “I’m not an outlaw,” he said. “I couldn’t handle those hours.”

Now in his 70s, with an affinity for Oxford-cloth shirts and canvas tote bags, Mr. Fadiman is busy collecting more than a thousand written reports from “citizen scientists,” who write to him from all over the world with descriptions of the benefits they’ve derived from microdosing psychedelics: to mood, health, work, even menstrual cramps.

So exactly why are we witnessing what many are calling a “renaissance” in psychedelic drugs now, when they’ve been around so long?

There are many theories, including that Big Pharma’s solutions to mental illness are not satisfactory to everyone; that the internet is helping to spread knowledge about the power and potential of these drugs; that ayahuasca — the tree-bark tea administered by shamans — has become so popular in certain enclaves in the United States that it’s helping revive interest in other psychedelics; or simply that baby boomers who discovered the wonders of LSD in the ’60s are now facing death, and looking, again, for ways to get in touch with their spirituality.

Like any movement, this one has its struggles.

On Saturday afternoon, in the Marriott’s jammed ballroom, Dr. Gabor Maté, a Canadian physician and expert in addiction who over the last decade has embraced the therapeutic potential of plant medicines, was finishing his speech when a woman with dark hair and dark sunglasses approached the microphone to ask a question.

In front of the huge crowd, she identified herself as “an indigenous person” and began to speak. “My heart is pounding in my chest like a jack rabbit because what I want to say is not necessarily going to make anybody happy,” she said. “But what I want to say is that cultural appropriation is a form of retraumatization to indigenous people.”

She was referring to the growing boom in American and European tourism to countries like Peru and Brazil for the purpose of taking part in healing ceremonies using psychedelic plants, which some people fear will threaten access for native populations to these ancient, sacred rites.

“You’re speaking from a deep wound,” Dr. Maté said. “But I cannot stand here and heal your wound.”

His response seemed to inflame the woman further. “That’s not what I’m asking for,” she said, and then she turned to the audience. “I’m asking for everyone here to just be accountable for your own white privilege.” With that, she walked quickly out of the room.

Her words seemed to strike a nerve: The crowd at the conference was indeed overwhelmingly white.

“I didn’t handle that one well,” Dr. Maté said later. “I had a plane to catch — and I got defensive, instead of listening. I sent her an apology. I was insensitive and condescending. It was a lesson for me in gender and cultural politics.”

Like many organizations, MAPS has someone devoted to diversifying the psychedelic community: Natalie Ginsberg, the policy and advocacy manager.“This whole issue of appropriation in this white psychedelic community is so important,” Ms. Ginsberg said. “I think that’s something that really needs to be addressed more fully in our science community, how we’re not fully recognizing the lineage of these substances.”

Debates around cultural appropriation aside, by Sunday night, a definite back-to-school melancholy was in the air at the Marriott. Shoes returned to feet, and PowerPoint slides were packed up to be carried home to East Coast labs. Wistful conversations turned to the subject of “reintegration” before many in the crowd of thousands said goodbye to new friends and began to disperse back into their normal lives, where most people around them are not privy to the psychedelic sense of what the world can be.

For the moment, anyway."
